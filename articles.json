    "title": "Overnight versus 24 hours of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion as supplement to oral antidiabetic drugs in type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Basal continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy at a fixed rate may effectively improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes when oral antidiabetic treatment fails. Regimens of simple constant subcutaneous delivery of insulin may provide theoretical advantages in type 2 diabetes.",
      "METHODS": "Ten subjects with type 2 diabetes who obtained insufficient glycemic control on oral antidiabetic drugs were included. Following an initial control day, two periods of 3 days with CSII of a rapid-acting insulin analogue, 1.5 IU/h (dose obtained from a preceding study), for 8 hours overnight and for 24 hours, respectively, were carried out in random order. Profiles of serum insulin aspart, serum endogenous insulin, and plasma glucose were recorded.",
      "RESULTS": "Compared to the control day, an 8-hour overnight insulin infusion during a 3-day period improved fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (mean differences +/- SEM; Delta59.0 +/- 10.1 mg/dl; p < 0.01) and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPPG) (Delta57.8 +/- 10.6 mg/dl; p < 0.01) after breakfast. Compared to an 8-hour overnight infusion, a 24-hour infusion further improved all three PPPG values after breakfast, lunch, and dinner (Delta28.8 +/- 8.1 mg/dl, Delta30.6 +/- 8.1 mg/dl, and Delta35.1 +/- 7.9 mg/dl; p < 0.01). During insulin infusion, only one hypoglycemic episode with PG <55.8 mg/dl and mild symptoms was recorded.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with a rapid-acting insulin analogue at a fixed rate of 1.5 IU/h, either overnight or for 24 hours, improved glycemic control without safety concerns in patients with type 2 diabetes who had secondary failure to oral antidiabetic drugs. The effect on FPG was similar for both treatments, whereas the effect on PPPG was superior when insulin was infused during the entire 24 hours."

    "title": "Basal-prandial insulin delivery in type 2 diabetes mellitus via the V-Go: a novel continuous subcutaneous infusion device.",
    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "The V-Go is a once-daily disposable device that allows coverage of basal and prandial insulin requirements over a period of 24 hours. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate the clinical functionality, safety, and pharmacodynamics of the V-Go delivering insulin aspart and redistributing a single basal dose of insulin glargine as a constant basal infusion supplemented with prandial insulin in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
      "METHODS": "In six subjects receiving once-daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of insulin glargine (> or =15 U/day) with or without concomitant oral antidiabetic drugs, glargine was discontinued following a 3-day baseline phase. The V-Go was then applied to the lower abdomen of the subjects once daily for 7 days (days 1-3 inpatient, days 4-7 outpatient). Each V-Go provided a continuous 24-hour preset basal infusion rate of insulin aspart (0.6 U/h) and up to three daily prandial doses at mealtimes. Capillary blood glucose concentrations were measured at 11 time points per day during the baseline and inpatient phases and at 4 time points per day during the outpatient phase. Additionally, glucose profiles were measured continuously on all days.",
      "RESULTS": "The V-Go was well tolerated and operated as anticipated. The mean +/- SEM prestudy daily dose of SC insulin glargine was 33.3 +/- 13.8 U; the mean daily total insulin aspart dose infused with the V-Go was 31.5 +/- 7.5 and 32.3 +/- 7.8 U for the inpatient and outpatient periods, respectively. Fasting blood glucose values were similar to those observed at baseline throughout the study, with nonsignificant (NS) reductions in readings collected during the outpatient phase before lunch (-35 +/- 27 mg/dl) and before dinner (-38 +/- 25 mg/dl). The 2-hour postprandial glucose trended lower from 231 to 195 mg/dl (NS) at breakfast, 234 to 166 mg/dl (NS) at lunch, and 222 to 171 mg/dl (NS) at dinner. Bedtime blood glucose decreased (mean change from baseline -52 +/- 21 mg/dl; P = 0.0313), as did nighttime (3:00 AM) measurements (-20 +/- 9 mg/dl; P = 0.0313). Overall glycemic control tended to improve, as shown by continuous glucose monitoring changing from 173 to 157 mg/dl (P = 0.063, NS) and 156 mg/dl (P = 0.219) during inpatient and outpatient periods, respectively. Glycemic variability assessed by the M value similarly tended to decrease from 33 +/- 9 to 25 +/- 4 (NS) and 21 +/- 4 (NS) for inpatient and outpatient periods, respectively.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "These first data suggest that use of the V-Go is an attractive alternative to SC insulin injection therapy because metabolic control appears to be maintained or even improved without increasing daily insulin doses."

    "title": "Intermittent fasting vs daily calorie restriction for type 2 diabetes prevention: a review of human findings.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) regimens have gained considerable popularity in recent years, as some people find these diets easier to follow than traditional calorie restriction (CR) approaches. IF involves restricting energy intake on 1-3 d/wk, and eating freely on the nonrestriction days. Alternate day fasting (ADF) is a subclass of IF, which consists of a \"fast day\" (75% energy restriction) alternating with a \"feed day\" (ad libitum food consumption). Recent findings suggest that IF and ADF are equally as effective as CR for weight loss and cardioprotection. What remains unclear, however, is whether IF/ADF elicits comparable improvements in diabetes risk indicators, when compared with CR. Accordingly, the goal of this review was to compare the effects of IF and ADF with daily CR on body weight, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese adults. Results reveal superior decreases in body weight by CR vs IF/ADF regimens, yet comparable reductions in visceral fat mass, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance. None of the interventions produced clinically meaningful reductions in glucose concentrations. Taken together, these preliminary findings show promise for the use of IF and ADF as alternatives to CR for weight loss and type 2 diabetes risk reduction in overweight and obese populations, but more research is required before solid conclusions can be reached."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Intermittent fasting, alternate-day fasting, and other forms of periodic caloric desistance are gaining popularity in the lay press and among animal research scientists. Whether clinical evidence exists for or is strong enough to support the use of such dietary regimens as health interventions is unclear.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "This review sought to identify rigorous, clinically relevant research studies that provide high-quality evidence that therapeutic fasting regimens are clinically beneficial to humans.",
      "DESIGN": "A systematic review of the published literature through January 2015 was performed by using sensitive search strategies to identify randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluated the effects of fasting on either clinically relevant surrogate outcomes (e.g., weight, cholesterol) or actual clinical event endpoints [e.g., diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD)] and any other studies that evaluated the effects of fasting on clinical event outcomes.",
      "RESULTS": "Three randomized controlled clinical trials of fasting in humans were identified, and the results were published in 5 articles, all of which evaluated the effects of fasting on surrogate outcomes. Improvements in weight and other risk-related outcomes were found in the 3 trials. Two observational clinical outcomes studies in humans were found in which fasting was associated with a lower prevalence of CAD or diabetes diagnosis. No randomized controlled trials of fasting for clinical outcomes were identified.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Clinical research studies of fasting with robust designs and high levels of clinical evidence are sparse in the literature. Whereas the few randomized controlled trials and observational clinical outcomes studies support the existence of a health benefit from fasting, substantial further research in humans is needed before the use of fasting as a health intervention can be recommended."

      "AIMS": "Weight loss improves glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, as achieving and maintaining weight loss is difficult, alternative strategies are needed. Our primary aim was to investigate the effects of intermittent energy restriction (IER) compared to continuous energy restriction (CER) on glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary aims were to assess effects on weight loss, body composition, medication changes and subjective measures of appetite. Using a 2-day IER method, we expected equal improvements to HbA1c and weight in both groups.",
      "METHOD": "Sixty-three overweight or obese participants (BMI 35.2±5kg/m",
      "RESULTS": "At 12weeks HbA1c (-0.7±0.9% P<0.001) and percent body weight reduction (-5.9±4% P<0.001) was similar in both groups with no group by time interaction. Similar reductions were also seen for medication dosages, all measures of body composition and subjective reports of appetite.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "In this pilot trial, 2days of IER compared with CER resulted in similar improvements in glycaemic control and weight reduction offering a suitable alternative treatment strategy."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "In developing countries the rise of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, reflects the changes in lifestyle habits and wrong dietary choices. Dietary restriction (DR) regimens have been shown to extend health span and lifespan in many animal models including primates. Identifying biomarkers predictive of clinical benefits of treatment is one of the primary goals of precision medicine. To monitor the clinical outcomes of DR interventions in humans, several biomarkers are commonly adopted. However, a validated link between the behaviors of such biomarkers and DR effects is lacking at present time. Through a systematic analysis of human intervention studies, we evaluated the effect size of DR (i.e. calorie restriction, very low calorie diet, intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting) on health-related biomarkers. We found that DR is effective in reducing total and visceral adipose mass and improving inflammatory cytokines profile and adiponectin/leptin ratio. By analysing the levels of canonical biomarkers of healthy aging, we also validated the changes of insulin, IGF-1 and IGFBP-1,2 to monitor DR effects. Collectively, we developed a useful platform to evaluate the human responses to dietary regimens low in calories."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "This review will examine topical issues in weight loss and weight maintenance in people with and without diabetes. A high protein, low glycemic index diet would appear to be best for 12-mo weight maintenance in people without type 2 diabetes. This dietary pattern is currently being explored in a large prevention of diabetes intervention. Intermittent energy restriction is useful but no better than daily energy restriction but there needs to be larger and longer term trials performed. There appears to be no evidence that intermittent fasting or intermittent severe energy restriction has a metabolic benefit beyond the weight loss produced and does not spare lean mass compared with daily energy restriction. Meal replacements are useful and can produce weight loss similar to or better than food restriction alone. Very low calorie diets can produce weight loss of 11-16 kg at 12 mo with persistent weight loss of 1-2 kg at 4-6 years with a very wide variation in long term results. Long term medication or meal replacement support can produce more sustained weight loss. In type 2 diabetes very low carbohydrate diets are strongly recommended by some groups but the long term evidence is very limited and no published trial is longer than 12 mo. Although obesity is strongly genetically based the microbiome may play a small role but human evidence is currently very limited."

    "abstract": {
      "AIMS": "The aims of this study were to determine the effects of four weeks of intermittent exposure to a moderate hypoxia environment (15% oxygen), and compare with the effects of exercise in normoxia or hypoxia, on glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, GLUT4 translocation, insulin receptor phosphorylation, Akt-dependent GSK3 phosphorylation and Akt activity in skeletal muscle of obese mice with type 2 diabetes.",
      "METHODS": "C57BL/6J mice that developed type 2 diabetes with a high-fat-diet (55% fat) (fasting blood glucose, FBG = 13.9 ± 0.69 (SD) mmol/L) were randomly allocated into diabetic control (DC), rest in hypoxia (DH), exercise in normoxia (DE), and exercise in hypoxia (DHE) groups (n = 7, each), together with a normal-diet (4% fat) control group (NC, FBG = 9.1 ± 1.11 (SD) mmol/L). The exercise groups ran on a treadmill at intensities of 75-90% VO2max. The interventions were applied one hour per day, six days per week for four weeks. Venous blood samples were analysed for FBG, insulin (FBI) and insulin sensitivity (QUICKI) pre and post the intervention period. The quadriceps muscle samples were collected 72 hours post the last intervention session for analysis of GLUT4 translocation, insulin receptor phosphorylation, Akt expression and phosphorylated GSK3 fusion protein by western blot. Akt activity was determined by the ratio of the phosphorylated GSK3 fusion protein to the total Akt protein.",
      "RESULTS": "The FBG of the DH, DE and DHE groups returned to normal level (FBG = 9.4 ± 1.50, 8.86 ± 0.94 and 9.0 ± 1.13 (SD) mmol/L for DH, DE and DHE respectively, P < 0.05), with improved insulin sensitivity compared to DC (P < 0.05), after the four weeks treatment, while the NC and DC showed no significant changes, as analysed by general linear model with repeated measures. All three interventions resulted in a significant increase of GLUT4 translocation to cell membrane compared to the DC group (P < 0.05). The DE and DH showed a similar level of insulin receptor phosphorylation compared with NC that was significantly lower than the DC (P < 0.05) post intervention. The DH and DHE groups showed a significantly higher Akt activity compared to the DE, DC and NC (P < 0.05) post intervention, as analysed by one-way ANOVA.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "This study produced new evidence that intermittent exposure to mild hypoxia (0.15 FiO2) for four weeks resulted in normalisation of FBG, improvement in whole body insulin sensitivity, and a significant increase of GLUT4 translocation in the skeletal muscle, that were similar to the effects of exercise intervention during the same time period, in mice with diet-induced type 2 diabetes. However, exercise in hypoxia for four weeks did not have additive effects on these responses. The outcomes of the research may contribute to the development of effective, alternative and complementary interventions for management of hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes, particularly for individuals with limitations in participation of physical activity."

    "abstract": {
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW": "Diet is a pillar of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management. Intermittent fasting (IF) is postulated as a novel approach, able to improve glucose control and potentially capable of reversing some of the pathophysiological alterations of this condition. In this review, the molecular and clinical evidence of diets based on intermittent energy restriction (IER) in laboratory animal models and subjects with type 2 diabetes is discussed. The mechanisms through which IF are thought to improve glucose homeostasis and reverse β cell failure are also reviewed.",
      "RECENT FINDINGS": "Studies derived from murine models suggest that IER is associated with improvements in β cell function and insulin resistance. Two main mechanisms have been demonstrated, one derived from the autophagy-lysosome pathway and, the other from an increase in neurogenin3 (Ngn3) levels (a marker for endocrine progenitor cells like β cells during development). Notably, IER also promotes reconstruction of gut microbiota. In mice, all effects were independent of weight loss. By contrast, in human studies, outcomes are widely attributable to weight loss. The more consistent results are reductions in body weight, visceral fat, and glucose and insulin levels. Increases in HDL cholesterol levels are also frequently reported. The decrease in insulin levels observed in humans is in opposition with the increase reported in mice, suggesting that the main mechanism in humans is an improvement in peripheral insulin action. Recommending diets based on intermittent fasting in humans is based on the promising results found in animal models where an improvement in β cell function has been recorded. β cell function after IF has not been assessed in human subjects with T2DM. This review provides information regarding different protocols for the implementation of IF in diabetic persons and also provides important safety advice in order to avoid adverse effects. Clinical studies do not show an increased risk of hypoglycemia, and a recent case series reported reversal of T2DM."

      "BACKGROUND & AIM": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is a dietary intervention that has been investigated as an alternative weight-loss diet due to conventional approaches having poor long-term adherence. However, the macronutrient and micronutrient intake and composition of IF diets have been overlooked. The primary aim of this study was to describe the macronutrient and micronutrient intake of individuals following the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet (IF 5:2).",
      "METHODS": "Thirty eight overweight and obese participants were included from two previous studies of IF 5:2. The participants selected included 27 males and 11 females, with and without Type 2 Diabetes. The dietary intervention, IF 5:2, consisted of two days per week fasting, either consecutive or non-consecutive, and five days per week of habitual intake. Prospectively completed 4-day estimated food records were used to assess macronutrient and micronutrient intake at baseline and week six. The 4-day records were weighted to give a mean daily intake during IF 5:2.",
      "RESULTS": "During IF 5:2 the median (25th, 75th quartile) daily macronutrient composition was 22 (19, 24)% from protein, 33 (29, 37)% from fat and 39 (36, 43)% from carbohydrates. The intake (g/d) of carbohydrates and fibre decreased significantly from baseline to week six (p < 0.001) as well as on fasting days compared to non-fasting days (p < 0.001). The intake of calcium, zinc, magnesium and potassium were lower than recommended guidelines. Sodium intake exceeded the suggested daily target. On fasting days, the percent of total energy from protein significantly increased from 21% to 25% (p = 0.02). Despite intake being unrestricted on non-fasting days the energy intake decreased by week six when compared with baseline.",
      "CONCLUSION": "The composition of IF 5:2 was a high protein, moderate fat, low carbohydrate diet with a low fibre intake. Some micronutrients have lower than recommended intake. However, overall IF 5:2 is a safe acceptable weight-loss diet strategy."

      "SUMMARY": "This case demonstrates the effective and sustainable use of intermittent fasting (IF) and ketogenic diet (KD) in a normal weight patient with type 2 diabetes, who did not attain glycaemic control with a standard care approach. A 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and strict adherence to a standard diabetic diet presented with a haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 9.3%. Within 4 months of transitioning to KD, combined with IF, she achieved glycaemic control off pharmacotherapy, with HbA1c of 6.4. IF regimens started as 24 hours three times per week, followed by 42 hours three times per week, then 42 hours two times per week and 16 hours once per week. A maintenance phase was then begun at 8 months; IF was reduced to 16 hours per day, with 24 hours three times per month, and metformin was restarted. At 14 months, HbA1c reached 5.8%, and body mass index was minimally changed."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an increasingly popular method of weight loss, as an alternative to daily caloric restriction (DCR). Several forms of IF exist, such as alternate-day fasting or time-restricted feeding regimens. Some of its proponents claim several health benefits unrelated to caloric restriction or weight loss, which rely mainly on animal models. Although several studies published in the last few years confirm that IF can be a useful and safe therapeutical option for obesity and related disorders, no superiority to conventional caloric restriction diets have emerged. There are still several questions left answered. In this Review, we discuss some of the claims, unveiling myths, facts, and presumptions about several models of IF. The focus of this article is obesity, but there is a brief discussion of the potential benefits of IF on overall human health."

      "BACKGROUND": "Intensive face-to-face weight loss programs using continuous low-energy diets (CLEDs) providing approximately 800 kcal per day (3347 kJ per day) can produce significant weight loss and remission from type 2 diabetes (T2D). Intermittent low-energy diets (ILEDs) and remotely delivered programs could be viable alternatives that may support patient choice and adherence.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "This paper describes the protocol of a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility and potential efficacy of remotely supported isocaloric ILED and CLED programs among patients with overweight and obesity and T2D.",
      "METHODS": "A total of 79 participants were recruited from primary care, two National Health Service hospital trusts, and a voluntary T2D research register in the United Kingdom. The participants were randomized to a remotely delivered ILED (n=39) or CLED (n=40). The active weight loss phase of CLED involved 8 weeks of Optifast 820 kcal/3430 kJ formula diet, followed by 4 weeks of food reintroduction. The active weight loss phase of ILED (n=39) comprised 2 days of Optifast 820 kcal/3430 kJ diet and 5 days of a portion-controlled Mediterranean diet for 28 weeks. Both groups were asked to complete 56 Optifast 820 kcal/3430 kJ days during their active weight loss phase with an equivalent energy deficit. The diets were isocaloric for the remainder of the 12 months. CLED participants were asked to follow a portion-controlled Mediterranean diet 7 days per week. ILED followed 1-2 days per week of a food-based 820 kcal/3430 kJ diet and a portion-controlled Mediterranean diet for 5-6 days per week. Participants received high-frequency (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly depending on the stage of the trial) multidisciplinary remote support from a dietitian, nurse, exercise specialist, and psychologist via telephone or the Oviva smartphone app. The primary outcomes of the study were uptake, weight loss, and changes in glycated hemoglobin at 12 months. An outcome assessment of trial retention was retrospectively added. Secondary outcomes included an assessment of adherence and adverse events. A qualitative evaluation was undertaken via interviews with participants and health care professionals who delivered the intervention.",
      "RESULTS": "A total of 79 overweight or obese participants aged 18-75 years and diagnosed with T2D in the last 8 years were recruited to the Manchester Intermittent and Daily Diet Diabetes App Study (MIDDAS).

    "title": "Effect of Various Types of Intermittent Fasting (IF) on Weight Loss and Improvement of Diabetic Parameters in Human.",
    "abstract": {
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW": "A number of recent studies have suggested that intermittent fasting is as effective as traditional calorie restriction (CR) for weight loss and for cardioprotection. However, it is still unclear whether IF improves diabetes risk indicators as does CR. This review provides an overview of various patterns of intermittent fasting and shows the effect of intermittent fasting on human anthropometric such as excess body weight and biochemical parameters for example high glucose and fasting insulin, which are risk factors for diabetes.",
      "RECENT FINDINGS": "There is a growing body of evidence pointing to the benefits of intermittent fasting for glucose and insulin homeostasis, but this should be confirmed by further studies in population groups with (or at high risk) type II diabetes and insulin resistance. Long-term studies are also needed that could reveal potential negative health effects that some studies report. Eleven studies in overweight/obese adult people that included changes in weight, body composition, and diabetic parameters (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c concentration, and HOMA-IR index) were published between 2012 and 2020. Seven studies concerning the effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) on weight loss and diabetic parameters were analyzed. All of them have shown the effects of ADF on weight loss and slight improvement in diabetic parameters. For time-restricted feeding (TRF), a significant improvement in the HOMA-IR index was observed in 2 studies. One study saw an increase in fasting glucose. An analysis of 2 studies using a complete alternate day fasting (CADF) was performed. One study showed decrease in fasting glucose and insulin, and in one a decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was observed.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Different types of intermittent fasting reduce body weight and reduce diabetes parameters such as fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR index, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)."

    "title": "A Clinical Perspective of Low Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diets: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Low carbohydrates diets (LCDs), which provide 20-120 g of carbohydrates per day, have long been used as therapeutic options in the treatment of severe obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and other morbid conditions, with good results in terms of weight loss and control of the main metabolic parameters, at least in the short and medium term. According to the caloric content and the macronutrient composition, we can classify LCDs in hypocaloric, normoproteic diets [such as the Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) or the protein-sparing modified fasting (PSMF)], hypocaloric, hyperproteic and hyperlipidic diets (e.g., Atkins, Paleo diets…) and normocaloric, normo-/hyperproteic diets (eucaloric KD), the latter mainly used in patients with brain tumors (gliomas) and refractory epilepsy. In addition to LCD diets, another interesting dietary approach which gained attention in the last few decades is fasting and its beneficial effects in terms of modulation of metabolic pathways, cellular processes and hormonal secretions. Due to the impossibility of using fasting regimens for long periods of time, several alternative strategies have been proposed that can mimic the effects, including calorie restriction, intermittent or alternating fasting, and the so-called fasting mimicking diets (FMDs). Recent preclinical studies have shown positive effects of FMDs in various experimental models of tumors, diabetes, Alzheimer Disease, and other morbid conditions, but to date, the scientific evidence in humans is limited to some opens studies and case reports. The purpose of our narrative review is to offer an overview of the characteristics of the main dietary regimens applied in the treatment of different clinical conditions as well as of the scientific evidence that justifies their use, focusing on low and zero-carb diets and on the different types of fasting."

    "title": "Intermittent Fasting: A User-Friendly Method for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an alarmingly rising disorder characterized mainly by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Due to the impairment of glucose homeostasis, most subjects present with elevated serum glucose levels, which can lead to several complications, including hospitalizations and even death. Diet quality and quantity are at the heart of its pathogenesis; hence, for the management of this condition, a technique known as intermittent fasting (IF) has been an area of interest for researchers. Different fasting regimens, including alternate-day fasting, religious fasting, and time-restricted fasting, have proven to be of strategic importance for glycemic control due to their physiologic effects. According to case studies and randomized trials, therapeutic fasting has been shown to reverse insulin resistance, resulting in the discontinuance of insulin therapy while maintaining blood sugar levels. Studies on IF have demonstrated their efficacy in glycemic control and other metabolic parameters, including reducing visceral fat and controlling inflammatory mediators and markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), but control in obesity is its most significant effect as it acts as a risk factor for T2DM. Several case studies have shown a reduction in elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in subjects after fasting, which some believe is due to sirtuin-6 (SIRT6) proteins. SIRT6 proteins are believed to be responsible for blood glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance reversal by increasing its sensitivity. This family of proteins is increased after fasting; hence, further research in this area will help researchers better understand its mechanism of action and potential therapeutic effects on T2DM. With an alarming increase in the incidence of T2DM around the world, a cost-effective strategy is required to control the disease with easy patient compliance, and IF might prove to be the solution."

Intermittent fasting could provide an alternative to classic caloric restriction in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of the study is to determine the impact of a 12-week intermittent fasting regimen compared with usual care in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving insulin therapy.",
      "METHODS": "This open, single-centre, randomized controlled trial investigates participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy and a glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of ≥53 mmol/mol (≥7.0%) and a minimum insulin dose of 0.3 IU/kg body weight per day. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 12 weeks of intermittent fasting or the standard care group. All participants receive dietary counselling, continuous glucose monitoring, measurement of the resting metabolic rate, an oral glucose tolerance test, body composition measurement via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and stool samples for microbiome analyses at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Two co-primary outcomes (analysed in hierarchical order) were chosen for the study: (i) the difference in the change of HbA1c from baseline to 12 weeks and (ii) the difference in the number of participants achieving a combined end point encompassing a body weight reduction of at least 2%, an insulin dose reduction of at least 10% and an absolute HbA1c reduction of at least 3 mmol/mol (0.3%) between the two groups."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Given the ongoing strain that the obesity epidemic has placed on public health outcomes, new and effective approaches to weight control are needed. One approach to improving weight and metabolic outcomes is intermittent fasting, which consists of multiple different timing schedules for temporary food avoidance, including alternate-day fasting, other similar full-day fasting patterns, and time-restricted feeding (where the day's food is consumed over a 6-h period, allowing for 18 h of fasting). These feeding schedules have favorable metabolic effects by intermittently inducing the metabolism of fatty acids to ketones. The regimens overall lead to a decrease in weight and have been linked to improvements in dyslipidemia and blood pressure. While more research is needed on longer-term outcomes and this approach should be avoided in particular health conditions, intermittent fasting should be considered as an option for individuals who have a pattern of unhealthy weight gain using standard eating patterns."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition that occurs in insulin-resistant people with reduced glucose uptake. It is contributed to and exacerbated by a poor diet that results in accumulation of adipose tissue, high blood sugar, and other metabolic issues. Because humans have undergone food scarcity throughout history, our species has adapted a fat reserve genotype. This adaptation is no longer beneficial, as eating at a higher frequency than that of our ancestors has had a significant effect on T2D development. Eating at high frequencies disrupts the circadian clock, the circadian rhythm, and the composition of the gut microbiome, as well as hormone secretion and sensitivity. The current literature suggests an improved diet requires meal consistency, avoiding late-night eating, low meal frequency, and fasting to increase metabolic health. In addition, fasting as a treatment for T2D must be used correctly for beneficial results. Early time-restricted eating (TRE) provides many benefits such as improving insulin resistance, cognitive function, and glycemic control. Alternate-day fasting (ADF), 5:2 fasting, and long-term fasting all have benefits; however, they may be less advantageous than early TRE. Therefore, eating pattern adjustments can be used to reduce T2D if used correctly."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Patients with type 2 diabetes often develop the microvascular complications of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which decrease quality of life and increase mortality. Unfortunately, treatment options for DKD and DPN are limited. Lifestyle interventions, such as changes to diet, have been proposed as non-pharmacological treatment options for preventing or improving DKD and DPN. However, there are no reported studies simultaneously evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of varying dietary interventions in a type 2 diabetes mouse model of both DKD and DPN. Therefore, we compared the efficacy of a 12-week regimen of three dietary interventions, low carbohydrate, caloric restriction, and alternate day fasting, for preventing complications in a db/db type 2 diabetes mouse model by performing metabolic, DKD, and DPN phenotyping. All three dietary interventions promoted weight loss, ameliorated glycemic status, and improved DKD, but did not impact percent fat mass and DPN. Multiple regression analysis identified a negative correlation between fat mass and motor nerve conduction velocity. Collectively, our data indicate that these three dietary interventions improved weight and glycemic status and alleviated DKD but not DPN. Moreover, diets that decrease fat mass may be a promising non-pharmacological approach to improve DPN in type 2 diabetes given the negative correlation between fat mass and motor nerve conduction velocity."

      "MATERIALS AND METHODS": "Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 3 months) were randomly assigned to the normal control (NC), diabetic control (DC), TRF, ADF, and PF groups. Type 2 diabetes was induced in all groups, except for the NC group, by intramuscular administration of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). The IF interventions were administered for 6 weeks.",
      "RESULTS": "The rats in all the groups, except for the NC group, exhibited significant weight loss (31.4%, 46.4%, 31.0%, and 33.9% in the DC, TRF, ADF, and PF groups, respectively). The fasting blood glucose levels decreased to varying degrees, with the PF group showing the most significant decrease (77.0%), followed by the ADF (55.0%) and TRF (32.2%) groups. The plasma insulin levels were significantly lower in the experimental groups than in the NC group, but no significant effects were observed on the lipid profile.",

      "BACKGROUND": "Intermittent hypoxia intervention (IHI) has been shown to reduces blood glucose and improves insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and has been suggested as a complementary or alternative intervention to exercise for individuals with limited mobility. Previous research on IHI has assessed cellular glucose uptake rather than utilization. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 4-week IHI, with or without an aerobic exercise, on skeletal muscle glucose utilization as indicated by the changes in pyruvate, lactate, NAD+, and NADH, using a mouse model of diet-induced T2D. In addition, the effects of one exposure to hypoxia (acute) and of a 4-week IHI (chronic) were compared to explore their relationship.",
      "METHODS": "C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to normal control and high-fat-diet groups, and the mice that developed diet-induced diabetes were assigned to diabetes control, and intervention groups with 1 hour (acute) or 4 weeks (1 hour/day, 6 days/week) exposure to a hypoxic envrionment (0.15 FiO2), exercise (treadmill run) in normoxia, and exercise in hypoxia, respectively, with N = 7 in each group. The effects of the interventions on concentrations of fasting blood glucose, muscle glucose, GLUT4, lactate, pyruvate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and NADH were measured, and statistically compared between the groups.",
      "RESULTS": "Compared with diabetes control group, the mice treated in the hypoxic environment for 4 weeks showed a significantly higher pyruvate levels and lower lactate/pyruvate ratios in the quadriceps muscle, and the mice exposed to hypoxia without or with aerobic exercise for either for 4 weeks or just 1 hour showed higher NAD+ levels and lower NADH/NAD+ ratios.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Exposure to moderate hypoxia for either one bout or 4 weeks significantly increased the body's mitochondrial NAD cyclethe in diabetic mice even in the absence of aerobic exercise. The hypoxia and exercise interventions exhibited synergistic effects on glycolysis. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the effects of IHI in respect of the management of hyperglycemia."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting has drawn significant interest in the clinical research community due to its potential to address metabolic complications such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Various intermittent fasting regimens include alternate-day fasting (24 h of fasting followed by 24 h of eating), time-restricted fasting (fasting for 14 h and eating within a 10 h window), and the 5:2 diet (fasting for two days and eating normally for the other five days). Intermittent fasting is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related complications and can slow their progression. The increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus highlights the importance of early management. Since prediabetes is a precursor to type 2 diabetes mellitus, understanding its progression is essential. However, the long-term effects of intermittent fasting on prediabetes are not yet well understood. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively compile existing knowledge on the therapeutic effects of intermittent fasting in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes."

      "BACKGROUND": "Cardiovascular disease represents a significant risk factor for mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is believed to play a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular health through its multifaceted atheroprotective effects and its capacity to enhance glycemic control. The impact of dietary interventions and intermittent fasting (IF) on HDL functionality remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of dietary interventions and IF as a strategy to safely improve glycemic control and reduce body weight on functional parameters of HDL in individuals with T2DM.",
      "METHODS": "Before the 12-week intervention, all participants (n = 41) of the INTERFAST-2 study were standardized to a uniform basal insulin regimen and randomized to an IF or non-IF group. Additionally, all participants were advised to adhere to dietary recommendations that promoted healthy eating patterns. The IF group (n = 19) followed an alternate-day fasting routine, reducing their calorie intake by 75% on fasting days. The participants' glucose levels were continuously monitored. Other parameters were measured following the intervention: Lipoprotein composition and subclass distribution were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity, paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, and cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) activity were assessed using cell-based assays and commercially available kits. Apolipoprotein M (apoM) levels were determined by ELISA.",
      "RESULTS": "Following the 12-week intervention, the IF regimen significantly elevated serum apoM levels (p = 0.0144), whereas no increase was observed in the non-IF group (p = 0.9801). ApoM levels correlated with weight loss and fasting glucose levels in the IF group. Both groups exhibited a robust enhancement in HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0006) after 12 weeks. Notably, only the non-IF group exhibited significantly elevated activity of PON1 (p = 0.0455) and LCAT (p = 0.0117) following the 12-week intervention. In contrast, the changes observed in the IF group did not reach statistical significance.",

Secondary efficacy outcomes at 4 and 12 months are changes in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and nocturnal glucose by continuous glucose monitor incremental area under the curve and change in HbA1c at 12 months. Other endpoints are exploratory and will not be adjusted for multiplicity.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "We will determine whether TRE is an alternate strategy to current practice in dietetics to improve glucose control.",

    "title": "Alternative splicing landscape in mouse skeletal muscle and adipose tissue: Effects of intermittent fasting and exercise.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Alternative splicing contributes to diversify the cellular protein landscape, but aberrant splicing is implicated in many diseases. To which extent mis-splicing contributes to insulin resistance as the causal defect of type 2 diabetes and whether this can be reversed by lifestyle interventions is largely unknown. Therefore, RNA sequencing data from skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of diabetes-susceptible NZO mice treated with or without intermittent fasting and of healthy C57BL/6J mice subjected to exercise were analyzed for alternative splicing differences using Whippet and rMATS. Diet and exercise interventions triggered comparable levels of splicing changes, although the splicing profile of skeletal muscle appeared to be more flexible than that of adipose tissue, with 72-114 differential splicing events in muscle and less than 25 in adipose tissue. Splicing changes induced by time-restricted feeding, alternate-day fasting and exercise were generally mild, with a maximal percent spliced in (PSI) difference of 67%, indicating that alternative splicing plays a rather minor role in lifestyle-induced adaptations of muscle and adipose tissue in mice. However, intron retention contributed to the regulation of gene expression, influencing genes whose expression was directly linked to phenotypic parameters (e.g. Eno2 and Pan2). Alternate-day fasting promoted skipping of exon 7 in Mlxipl (coding for ChREBP), thereby affecting the glucose sensing module of this carbohydrate-responsive transcription factor. Both intermittent fasting and exercise training led to alternative splicing of known diabetes-related GWAS genes (e.g. Abcc8, Ifnar2, Smarcad1), highlighting the potential metabolic relevance of these changes."

    "abstract": {
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW": "In this review, we summarize the molecular effects of time-restricted eating (TRE) and its possible role in appetite regulation. We also discuss the potential clinical benefits of TRE in obesity.",
      "RECENT FINDINGS": "TRE is an emerging dietary approach consisting in limiting food intake to a specific window of time each day. The rationale behind this strategy is to restore the circadian misalignment, commonly seen in obesity. Preclinical studies have shown that restricting food intake only during the active phase of the day can positively influence several cellular functions including senescence, mitochondrial activity, inflammation, autophagy and nutrients' sensing pathways. Furthermore, TRE may play a role by modulating appetite and satiety hormones, though further research is needed to clarify its exact mechanisms. Clinical trials involving patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes suggest that TRE can be effective for weight loss, but its broader effects on improving other clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular risk factors, remain less certain. The epidemic proportions of obesity cause urgency to find dietary, pharmacological and surgical interventions that can be effective in the medium and long term. According to its molecular effects, TRE can be an interesting alternative to caloric restriction in the treatment of obesity, but the considerable variability across clinical trials regarding population, intervention, and follow-up duration makes it difficult to reach definitive conclusions."

    "title": "Reshaping lipid metabolism with long-term alternate day feeding in type 2 diabetes mice.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Strategies to improve metabolic health include calorie restriction, time restricted eating and fasting several days per week or month. These approaches have demonstrated benefits for individuals experiencing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and prediabetes. However, their impact on established diabetes remains incompletely studied. The chronicity of type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires that interventions must be undertaken for extended periods of time, typically the entire lifetime of the individual. In this study, we examined the impact of intermittent fasting (IF), with an every-other-day protocol for a duration of 6 months in a murine model of T2D, the db/db (D) mouse on metabolism and liver steatosis. We compared D-IF mice with diabetic ad-libitum (AL; D-AL), control-IF (C-IF) and control-AL (C-AL) cohorts. We demonstrated using lipidomic, microbiome, metabolomic and liver transcriptomic studies that chronic IF improved carbohydrate utilization and glucose homeostasis without weight loss and reduced white adipose tissue inflammation and significantly impacted lipid metabolism in the liver. Microbiome studies and predicted functional analysis of gut microbiota showed that IF increased beneficial bacteria involved in sphingolipid (SL) metabolism. The metabolomic studies showed that oxidation of lipid species and ceramide levels were reduced in D-IF compared to D-AL. The liver lipidomic analysis and liver microarray confirmed a reduction in overall lipid content in D-IF mice compared to D-AL mice, especially in the feeding state as well as an overall reduction in oxidized lipids and ceramides. These studies support that long-term IF can improve glucose homeostasis and dramatically altered lipid metabolism in the absence of weight loss."

    "title": "Compounded Tirzepatide Therapy for Weight Loss: A Health Economics & Outcomes Research (HEOR) Analysis.",
    "abstract": {
      "OBJECTIVE": "A male health outcomes investigator, in age bracket 55 - 65, with BMI = 27 kg/m2, but without type 2 diabetes, took compounded tirzepatide 7.5 mg/week therapy as an experiment to see if he could achieve a 10% reduction in body weight over approximately four weeks and restore BMI = 25 kg/m2. Secondary endpoints included maintenance of weight-lifting strength, maintenance of speed and endurance in lap swimming, and maintenance of a nutrient-dense vegan diet. This study was undertaken to address some of the claims currently circulating in popular media about tirzepatide and the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) class of injectable drugs. All previous medical journal articles that mention the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) tirzepatide have referred to the branded drug, while this article is the first one focused on compounded tirzepatide.",
      "METHODS": "The investigator received weekly subcutaneous injections of 7.5 mg compounded tirzepatide over four weeks at a cost of $400 for four prefilled syringes. In the first, third, and fourth weeks, the investigator received 7.5 mg of compounded tirzepatide as a bolus injection. In week 2, the 7.5 mg dose was distributed over two injections of approximately 3.75 mg each given two days apart. The investigator recorded any lifestyle changes or changes in eating habits that resulted from this short duration study on the effects of tirzepatide for weight loss.",
      "RESULTS": "With four weeks of compounded tirzepatide therapy, the investigator achieved a 5% reduction in body weight and a BMI of 25.8. Despite continuing to participate in daily exercise, having a healthy vegan diet, and supplementing with many vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and nutrient-dense foods, the investigator regained 5% body weight within two weeks after the conclusion of the study. The investigator experienced side effects similar to those reported for GLP-1 RA class of injectable drugs, including tirzepatide. However, the treatment revealed an undulating pattern in which the compounded tirzepatide injection produced the desired effects, but intermittently the patient experienced neither a sense of satiety nor a sense of delayed digestion post injections, therefore, ate a normal meal and/or snacks. Adverse events included generalized bloating and flatulence, carbohydrate-specific temporary weight gain and bloating, intestinal rapid emptying comparable to excessive laxative use, and profound thirst with water consumption approximately double his normal level. Weight-lifting strength was maintained across a wide variety of equipment stations; lap swimming speed was maintained, and endurance was increased on compounded tirzepatide therapy. Apparent negative and positive neuroplasticity in the study period enabled the investigator to overcome a craving for one high caloric sugary snack, and to overcome an endurance barrier in the laps swam per set and per workout. These two results might be explained by performance bias, which arises from behavioral changes by participants or researchers due to awareness of the assigned interventions.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "The compounded tirzepatide tested in this 4-week study produced less weight loss than was intended and side effects that would be intolerable in a work environment with nearby colleagues. Compounded tirzepatide was a useful tool to enable this study of the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), also known as gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and GLP-1 RA class of drugs in chronic weight management. However, a 7.5 mg weekly dose of compounded API tirzepatide over four weeks is unlikely to produce a lasting 10% reduction in body weight even for those patients practicing intermittent fasting, choosing a vegan diet, and performing weight-bearing exercise and cardiovascular exercise daily. After cessation of therapy, the investigator's lost weight was regained, representing the weight gain relapse observed in some real-world settings associated with injectable weight loss drugs. Arguably, the dual GIP RA and GLP-1 RA drugs take patients on a proverbial roller coaster ride of weight loss and regain and intense yo-yo dieting. Patients on tirzepatide or semaglutide might benefit most not from realizing some short-term weight loss goal, but from lasting neuroplasticity-like changes in memory, rewards, and elimination of one or more particular food cravings based on the brain's ability to create, organize, and reorganize connections between neurons."

      "AIM": "To assess the attainability of the TITR (70-140 mg/dL) target in youth with diabetes using different treatment strategies during Ramadan fasting.",
      "METHODS": "This prospective study included 276 non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 426 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who were categorized into: multiple daily injections [MDI] + intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM), sensor augmented pump (SAP) and advanced hybrid closed loop (AHCL).",
      "RESULTS": "At the end of Ramadan, the mean TITR was 42.3 ± 6.6 % for all T1DM patients and 63.5 ± 4.0 % in T2DM (p < 0.001). The highest TITR was in T2DM group together with T1DM on AHCL (62.3 ± 11.6 %), followed by SAP group (37.7 ± 5.7 %) and MDI + isCGM group (23.6 ± 5.9 %, p < 0.001). Hypoglycemic episodes as shown by time below range (TBR) < 70 mg/dL and TBR < 54 mg/dL were minimal during Ramadan in AHCL group in comparison to before Ramadan (2.6 ± 0.7 versus 2.9 ± 0.9 %; p = 0.061 and 0.4 ± 0.1 vs 0.5 ± 0.1 %, p = 0.561, respectively) with a lower coefficient of variation (CoV) (p < 0.001) than other T1DM participants.",
      "CONCLUSION": "At the end of Ramadan, TITR was decreased in patients with T1DM except those using AHCL who had similar levels to non-insulin-treated T2DM patients. Advanced technology has the potential for achieving tight glycemic targets, along with a reduction in CoV, without increasing hypoglycemic risk compared with other insulin treatment modalities."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) represents a major global health issue, with its incidence anticipated to increase markedly in the forthcoming decades. Efficient non-pharmacological therapies, especially dietary approaches, are essential for regulating glycemic control and facilitating weight reduction. Intermittent Fasting (IF) and Continuous Caloric Restriction (CCR) are two well researched methodologies, but their relative effectiveness and enduring advantages continue to be topics of active discussion. This review systematically assesses and contrasts the impacts of intermittent fasting (IF) and continuous calorie restriction (CCR) on glycemic regulation and weight reduction in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), highlighting their short-term and long-term effects, safety profiles, and adherence rates. A thorough literature analysis was performed utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar, concentrating on papers published from 2000 to 2024. The review encompassed randomized controlled trials and observational studies that investigated the effects of intermittent fasting (IF) and continuous calorie restriction (CCR) on glycemic indicators (HbA1c, fasting glucose) and body weight. IF shown substantial short-term advantages, encompassing marked decreases in HbA1c levels, fasting glucose, and body weight. Mechanistic discoveries emphasized better insulin sensitivity, augmented fat metabolism, and autophagy as key aspects. In contrast, CCR was linked to enduring metabolic enhancements, including decreased visceral fat and improved insulin sensitivity. Nevertheless, both dietary approaches demonstrated constraints."

      "BACKGROUND": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has received wide attention as an effective diet strategy. Existing studies showed that IF is a promising approach for weight control, improving insulin sensitivity and reducing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevalence.",
      "METHODS": "Twenty-eight 8-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into a normal control group (NC), a high-fat diet group (HFD) and an HFD + IF group. Body weight (BW) and food intake were monitored weekly. After 20 weeks, the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT) were performed weekly in sequence. Fresh faeces were collected to examine changes in gut microbiota, and serum untargeted metabolite profiling was conducted on serum samples.",
      "RESULTS": "IF significantly reduced weight gain, fat mass and liver weight, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in middle-aged mice fed with high-fat diet. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that IF significantly reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio by increased Muribaculaceae, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and decreased Bilophila, Colidextribacter, Oscillibacter. The serum untargeted metabolomics revealed that IF could modulate differential metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with glycolipid metabolism. Spearman's correlation analysis indicated that key differential microbiota were strongly correlated with glucose metabolism-related indicators and serum metabolites such as stearic acid, obeticholic acid, and N-acetylglycine.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "IF improves glucose metabolism, regulates gut microbiota, and alters serum metabolites in middle-aged mice fed a high-fat diet. This provides a new pathway for trials testing diabetes prevention in middle-aged and elderly patients."

Métodos: se realizaron búsquedas sistemáticas de ensayos controlados y aleatorizados (ECA) en PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, MEDLINE y CNKI sobre la eficacia de las intervenciones de IF en la T2DM, desde la construcción de la base de datos hasta septiembre de 2024. Se realizó un metanálisis con el software RevMan 5.3. Resultados: se incluyeron 16 ensayos con un total de 5369 pacientes. El metaanálisis mostró que el IF mejoró la hemoglobina glicada, la glucosa en ayunas, el peso corporal, el IMC, el perímetro de la cintura, la presión arterial sistólica y diastólica, el LDL y el colesterol en los pacientes, comparados con los controles (p < 0,05). No hubo diferencias estadísticamente significativas (p > 0,05) en la mejora de los niveles postprandiales de glucosa, HDL y triglicéridos en comparación con los controles. Conclusión: el IF puede ayudar a los pacientes con T2DM a controlar los niveles de glucosa de manera efectiva. Además, el IF puede reducir el peso, reducir la cintura, mantener la presión arterial estable y reducir los niveles de LDL y colesterol total. Se considera seguro y viable. Sin embargo, se necesitan más estudios de alta calidad para demostrar más los beneficios del IF en la mejora de los niveles de otros lípidos."

      "BACKGROUND": "Epidemiological studies indicate a strong association between OSA and type 2 diabetes. Currently, the insulin signal transduction pathway and its associated effector proteins have emerged as a focal point in type 2 diabetes research. However, the underlying mechanisms in OSA remain elusive. We have established an experimental model of chronic intermittent hypoxia in SD rats and conducted measurements of their fasting blood glucose, fasting plasma insulin levels, as well as the insulin signaling pathway effector proteins IRS-2, P-Akt, and GSK-3.",
      "METHOD": "In the experiment, the gas path control system connected to a sealed glass container regulated the delivery of oxygen and nitrogen, ensuring a minimum oxygen concentration of 6%-12% within the cabin. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups (n = 8) and exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia or normal air environment for 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively. Upon completion of the experiment, the rats were anesthetized and euthanized. Immediately thereafter, their fasting blood glucose was measured, and their fasting insulin levels were determined using radioimmunoassay. Finally, the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) was calculated based on the steady-state model evaluation method. HE staining was employed to observe the morpho- logical changes of liver cells in each group of rats. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to detect the expression of insulin signaling pathway-related effector proteins, namely IRS-2, p-Akt, and GSK-3, in the liver, with their expression levels expressed as average grayscale values.",
      "RESULT": "With the extension of intermittent hypoxia exposure duration, compared to the normal control group, the fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance index of rats in each experimental group increased (n = 8, P < 0.05). Additionally, the liver cells of rats exhibited damage and morphological changes. The expression of liver pathway proteins IRS-2 and P-Akt decreased (n = 8, P < 0.05), whereas the expression of GSK-3 protein increased (n = 8, P < 0.05).",
      "CONCLUSION": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia activates the proteins IRS-2, P-Akt, and GSK-3 in the hepatic insulin signaling pathway, leading to liver cell damage, insulin resistance, and glucose metabolism disorders."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "This meta-analysis aimed to determine the short- (< 3 months) and long-term (≥ 3 months) metabolic effects of IF in patients with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that IF is non-inferior to other dietary control methods (including continuous energy restriction, standard diet, Mediterranean diet and ad libitum diet) in terms of both short-term and long-term metabolic impacts in patients with type 2 diabetes. We searched for studies in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library until August 20, 2023. Studies with non-type 2 diabetes patients, interventions other than IF, no control group, or non-randomized clinical trial designs were excluded. A meta-analysis was then conducted with a random effects model. The Risk of Bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2). 12 articles with a total of 966 participants were included. IF significantly decreased glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.64, -0.22; P = 0.01), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (SMD: -0.73; 95% CI: -0.92, -0.54; P < 0.00001) and body weight (SMD: -1.11; 95% CI: -1.92, -0.31; P = 0.007) in the short term compared to control interventions, but showed a similar effect to control interventions in the long term. Substantial heterogeneity existed among our studies. Over the intervention period, long-term IF may safely and feasibly help patients with type 2 diabetes effectively manage blood sugar and reduce body weight, but the metabolic benefits of IF don't endure after its discontinuation. Therefore, continual long-term IF may provide more lasting metabolic benefits."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation, significantly increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Effective management of MetS is critical, with exercise being a key intervention. This review analyzed the effects of different exercise intensities-low, moderate, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT)-on metabolic health, oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, and cardiovascular function. A search of Medline, PEDro, and EBSCO identified 2251 articles, with 159 studies published between 1999 and 2025 included after screening. Low-intensity exercise improved insulin sensitivity, reduced OS markers (e.g., MDA, 8-OHdG), and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. Moderate-intensity exercise showed similar benefits with notable reductions in inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α). HIIT promoted fat loss and improved metabolic markers but temporarily increased OS and inflammation. Dietary strategies also play a critical role. The Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are well established, emphasizing nutrient-dense foods like unsaturated fats and fiber to reduce inflammation and manage weight. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat, low-carbohydrate approach, has recently gained attention for its metabolic benefits. KD induces ketosis, improving insulin sensitivity, reducing triglycerides, and enhancing fat oxidation. Studies show KD effectively reduces body weight and glucose levels, though long-term adherence and nutrient deficiencies remain challenges. Intermittent fasting also showed potential benefits, though effects on glucose metabolism were inconsistent. This review underscores the need for tailored approaches combining exercise, diet, and fasting to optimize MetS outcomes, offering integrative strategies for prevention and management."

      "OBJECTIVE": "To assess the effect of intermittent fasting diets, with continuous energy restriction or unrestricted (ad-libitum) diets on intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes from randomised clinical trials.",
      "DESIGN": "Systematic review and network meta-analysis.",
      "DATA SOURCES": "Medline, Embase, and central databases from inception to 14 November 2024.",
      "ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES": "Randomised clinical trials comparing the association of intermittent fasting diets (alternate day fasting, time restricted eating, and whole day fasting), continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets were included.",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES": "Outcomes included body weight (primary) and measures of anthropometry, glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and markers of liver disease.",
      "DATA SYNTHESIS": "A network meta-analysis based on a frequentist framework was performed with data expressed as mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE).",
      "RESULTS": "99 randomised clinical trials involving 6582 adults of varying health conditions (720 healthy, 5862 existing health conditions) were identified. All intermittent fasting and continuous energy restriction diet strategies reduced body weight when compared with ad-libitum diet. Compared with continuous energy restriction, alternate day fasting was the only form of intermittent fasting diet strategy to show benefit in body weight reduction (mean difference -1.29 kg (95% CI -1.99 to -0.59), moderate certainty of evidence). Additionally, alternate day fasting showed a trivial reduction in body weight compared with both time restricted eating and whole day fasting (mean difference -1.69 kg (-2.49 to -0.88) and -1.05 kg (-1.90 to -0.19), respectively, both with moderate certainty of evidence). Estimates were similar among trials with less than 24 weeks follow-up (n=76); however, moderate-to-long-term trials (≥24 weeks, n=17) only showed benefits in weight reduction in diet strategies compared with ad-libitum. Furthermore, in comparisons between intermittent fasting strategies, alternate day fasting lowered total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high density lipoprotein compared with time restricted eating. Compared with whole day fasting, however, time restricted eating resulted in a small increase in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol. No differences were noted between intermittent fasting, continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets for HbA",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Minor differences were noted between some intermittent fasting diets and continuous energy restriction, with some benefit of weight loss with alternate day fasting in shorter duration trials. The current evidence provides some indication that intermittent fasting diets have similar benefits to continuous energy restriction for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longer duration trials are needed to further substantiate these findings.",

      "BACKGROUND": "Effective glucose management is essential to prevent complications in type 1 diabetes. While nutrition therapy is crucial, the optimal diet remains uncertain. Our systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the impact of various diets on glucose management in type 1 diabetes.",
      "METHODS": "We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to 11 November 2024 for RCTs on dietary patterns and glucose control outcomes in type 1 diabetes, including HbA1c, time in range (TIR), coefficient of variation (CV), hypoglycemia, insulin dose, and anthropometric characteristics. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the RoB-2 tool. We estimated summary mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs using random-effects models. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023479252).",

      "METHODS": "A narrative review of recent scientific literature examining the physiological mechanisms, clinical outcomes, and practical implementation of IF and KD in patients with MetS and T2D. The focus is on studies evaluating glycemic control, body weight, lipid profiles, and inflammation, as well as the proposed shared biochemical pathways involving AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition.",
      "RESULTS": "Both IF and KD independently show clinically significant benefits in improving metabolic parameters in MetS and T2D, including reductions in HbA1c, fasting glucose, body weight, and triglycerides. Mechanistically, both approaches enhance insulin sensitivity, promote autophagy, reduce inflammation, and activate energy-regulating pathways (AMPK) while inhibiting mTOR. Emerging evidence suggests that combining IF and KD may offer synergistic metabolic effects, although data on long-term safety, adherence, and patient-specific suitability remain limited.",

      "SUMMARY": "This non-randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effect of the 5:2 diet on insulin levels as a primary outcome and markers of insulin secretion (connecting peptide (C-peptide) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1)) and sensitivity (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)), as well as body composition as secondary outcomes in overweight/obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Ninety-seven participants (62% women), 35 with T2D and 62 BMI- and waist-matched controls without T2D, followed the 5:2 diet (two days per week of fasting) for six months with a 12-month follow-up. At six months, there was no loss to follow-up in the T2D group, whereas four controls discontinued this study. Overall, 82% attended the 12-month follow-up. After the intervention, insulin levels decreased in the control group and glucose decreased in the T2D group, while C-peptide, HOMA-IR, waist circumference, BMI, trunk, and total fat% decreased in both groups. Furthermore, low IGFBP-1, indicating hyperinsulinemia, improved in the T2D group. The changes in fasting glucose and waist measurement were significantly more improved in the T2D group than in the controls. Persistent positive effects were observed at the 12-month follow-up. The 5:2 diet for six months was feasible and efficient to reduce markers of insulin secretion and resistance and therefore holds promise as management of overweight/obesity in subjects with and without T2D."

      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is a convenient dietary intervention for multiple diseases, including type 2 diabetes. However, whether it can be used as a long-term antidiabetic approach is still unknown. Here, we confirm that IF alone is beneficial for both moderate and severe diabetic mice, but its antidiabetic effects clearly diminish at later stages, especially for severe diabetic db/db mice, which have obviously impaired autophagy. We found that static magnetic fields can directly promote actin assembly and boost IF-induced autophagy. Consequently, the pancreatic islet and liver were improved, and the antidiabetic effects of IF were boosted. In fact, at later stages, combined static magnetic field and IF could reduce the blood glucose level of moderate type 2 diabetic mice by 40.5% ("

      "OBJECTIVE": "We evaluated whether TRE can improve pancreatic β-cell function and metabolic status in overweight individuals with early T2DM.",
      "METHODS": "In a randomized, crossover trial, 39 participants (mean 2.9 years of diabetes duration, baseline glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 6.6% ± 0.7% and body mass index [BMI] 32.4 ± 5.7) were randomly assigned to either an initial intervention consisting of 6 weeks of TRE (20 h-fasting/4 h-eating) or standard lifestyle. The primary outcome of β-cell function was assessed by the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) derived from an oral glucose tolerance test.",
      "RESULTS": "As compared to standard lifestyle, TRE induced a 14% increase in ISSI-2 (+14.0 ± 39.2%; P = .03) accompanied by a 14% reduction of hepatic insulin resistance as evaluated by HOMA-IR (-11.6% [-49.3 to 21.9]; P = .03). Fasting glucose did not differ between interventions, but TRE yielded a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c (-0.32 ± 0.48%; P < .001).

      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) modifies cell- and tissue-specific immunometabolic responses that dictate metabolic flexibility and inflammation during obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Fasting forces periods of metabolic flexibility and necessitates increased use of different substrates. IF can lower metabolic inflammation and improve glucose metabolism without lowering obesity and can influence time-dependent, compartmentalized changes in immunity. Liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and immune cells communicate to relay metabolic and immune signals during fasting. Here we review the connections between metabolic and immune cells to explain the divergent effects of IF compared with classic caloric restriction (CR) strategies. We also explore how the immunometabolism of metabolic diseases dictates certain IF outcomes, where the gut microbiota triggers changes in immunity and metabolism during fasting."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Background Quality of Life (QoL) is an essential consideration in healthcare. Numerous studies have examined QoL in India; however, data on QoL following different dietary interventions are lacking. Similarly, the use of technology such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for diabetes care has independently demonstrated improvements in glycemic control; however, its association with QoL remains limited. Purpose The purpose was to study the role of different dietary interventions on QoL and its association with Time in Range (TIR), Time Above Range (TAR), and Time Below Range (TBR) among the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) population. Methodology A crossover interventional clinical trial (CTRI/2022/07/044356) was conducted among participants with T2DM of less than 5 years' duration, aged between 25 and 55 years, with an HbA1c level of less than 8%, and who were on Metformin only. Their QoL was assessed after following two diet patterns: the Continuous Calorie Restricted Diet (CCRD) - calorie reduction with small frequent meals, and Time Restricted Intermittent Fasting (TRIF) - calorie reduction with only two meals a day, using the Modified QoL (MDQOL-17) questionnaire. The association between post-dietary interventions QoL and TIR was studied using a 14-day CGM device. Results The overall QoL of 51 participants at the end of the dietary interventions was significantly better compared to their QoL before any dietary intervention (85.6±19.0% and 63.1±13.0%, respectively, p = 0.000). Decreased TIR correlated with increased role limitations due to physical functioning (p = 0.002) and decreased energy levels (p = 0.00). As TBR increased, role limitation due to emotional well-being increased, and energy levels decreased significantly (p = 0.01). As TAR increased, energy levels decreased (p = 0.01). A simple linear regression model was statistically significant for role limitations due to physical functioning (p = 0.003) and energy fatigue (p = 0.000), suggesting that higher TIR is associated with higher scores in these domains. Conclusion Dietary interventions that improve the TIR and reduce the TAR and TBR can enhance the QoL of individuals with T2DM."

However, studies of multiple continuous glucose monitoring metrics combined and their association with other adverse pregnancy outcomes are limited.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "This study aimed to (1) use machine learning techniques to identify discrete glucose profiles based on weekly continuous glucose monitoring metrics in pregnant individuals with pregestational diabetes mellitus and (2) investigate their association with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",
      "STUDY DESIGN": "This study analyzed data from a retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus who used Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring and delivered a nonanomalous, singleton pregnancy at a tertiary center between 2019 and 2023. Continuous glucose monitoring data were collapsed into 39 weekly glycemic measures related to centrality, spread, excursions, and circadian cycle patterns. Principal component analysis and k-means clustering were used to identify 4 discrete groups, and patients were assigned to the group that best represented their continuous glucose monitoring patterns during pregnancy. Finally, the association between glucose profile groups and outcomes (preterm birth, cesarean delivery, preeclampsia, large-for-gestational-age neonate, neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal intensive care unit admission) was estimated using multivariate logistic regression adjusted for diabetes mellitus type, maternal age, insurance, continuous glucose monitoring use before pregnancy, and parity.",
      "RESULTS": "Of 177 included patients, 90 (50.8%) had type 1 diabetes mellitus, and 85 (48.3%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study identified 4 glucose profiles: (1) well controlled; (2) suboptimally controlled with high variability, fasting hypoglycemia, and daytime hyperglycemia; (3) suboptimally controlled with minimal circadian variation; and (4) poorly controlled with peak hyperglycemia overnight. Compared with the well-controlled profile, the suboptimally controlled profile with high variability had higher odds of a large-for-gestational-age neonate (adjusted odds ratio, 3.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-9.89). The suboptimally controlled with minimal circadian variation profile had higher odds of preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-6.24), cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-7.46), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio, 4.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-11.40). The poorly controlled profile with peak hyperglycemia overnight had higher odds of preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-6.52), large-for-gestational-age neonate (adjusted odds ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-10.4), neonatal hypoglycemia (adjusted odds ratio, 3.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-9.71), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio, 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-9.09).",
      "CONCLUSION": "Discrete glucose profiles of pregnant individuals with pregestational diabetes mellitus were identified through joint consideration of multiple continuous glucose monitoring metrics. Prolonged exposure to maternal hyperglycemia may be associated with a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes than suboptimal glycemic control characterized by high glucose variability and intermittent hyperglycemia."

      "SUMMARY": "Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is caused by the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. T2DM is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin secretion deficiency and insulin resistance. Chronic hyperglycemia induces β-cell dysfunction, loss of β-cell mass/identity and β-cell dedifferentiation. Intermittent fasting (IF) a commonly used dietary regimen for weight-loss, also induces metabolic benefits including reduced blood glucose, improved insulin sensitivity, reduced adiposity, inflammation, oxidative-stress and increased fatty-acid oxidation; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects in pancreatic β-cells remain elusive.

    "title": "Understanding Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Risk Parameters through Intermittent Fasting: A Machine Learning Approach.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Despite the availability of pharmacological treatments, dietary plans, and exercise regimens, T2DM remains a significant global cause of mortality. As a result, there is an increasing interest in exploring lifestyle interventions, such as intermittent fasting (IF). This study aims to identify underlying patterns and principles for effectively improving T2DM risk parameters through IF. By analyzing data from multiple randomized clinical trials investigating various IF interventions in humans, a machine learning algorithm was employed to develop a personalized recommendation system. This system offers guidance tailored to pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals, suggesting the most suitable IF interventions to improve T2DM risk parameters. With a success rate of 95%, this recommendation system provides highly individualized advice, optimizing the benefits of IF for diverse population subgroups. The outcomes of this study lead us to conclude that weight is a crucial feature for females, while age plays a determining role for males in reducing glucose levels in blood. By revealing patterns in diabetes risk parameters among individuals, this study not only offers practical guidance but also sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of T2DM, contributing to a deeper understanding of this complex metabolic disorder."

      "BACKGROUND": "Accurately identifying eating patterns, specifically the timing, frequency, and distribution of eating occasions (EOs), is important for assessing eating behaviors, especially for preventing and managing obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, existing methods to study EOs rely on self-report, which may be prone to misreporting and bias and has a high user burden. Therefore, objective methods are needed.",
      "METHODS": "We aim to compare EO timing using objective and subjective methods. Participants self-reported EO with a smartphone app (self-report [SR]), wore the ActiGraph GT9X on their dominant wrist, and wore a continuous glucose monitor (CGM, Abbott Libre Pro) for 10 days. EOs were detected from wrist motion (WM) using a motion-based classifier and from CGM using a simulation-based system. We described EO timing and explored how timing identified with WM and CGM compares with SR.",

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Over the last decade, studies suggested that dietary behavior modification, including fasting, can improve metabolic and cardiovascular markers as well as body composition. Given the increasing prevalence of people with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the increasing obesity (also in combination with diabetes), nutritional therapies are gaining importance, besides pharmaceutical interventions. Fasting has demonstrated beneficial effects for both healthy individuals and those with metabolic diseases, leading to increased research interest in its impact on glycemia and associated short- and long-term complications. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate whether fasting can be used safely and effectively in addition to medications to support the therapy in T1DM and T2DM. A literature search on fasting and its interaction with diabetes was conducted via PubMed in September 2022. Fasting has the potential to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in T1DM, lower glycaemic variability, and improve fat metabolism in T1DM and T2DM. It also increases insulin sensitivity, reduces endogenous glucose production in diabetes, lowers body weight, and improves body composition. To conclude, fasting is efficient for therapy management for both people with T1DM and T2DM and can be safely performed, when necessary, with the support of health care professionals."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) is a dynamic hair-like layer expressed on the apical surface of endothelial cells throughout the vascular system. This layer serves as an endothelial cell gatekeeper by controlling the permeability and adhesion properties of endothelial cells, as well as by controlling vascular resistance through the mediation of vasodilation. Pathogenic destruction of the eGC could be linked to impaired vascular function, as well as several acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. Defining the precise functions and mechanisms of the eGC is perhaps the limiting factor of the missing link in finding novel treatments for lifestyle-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. However, the relationship between diet, lifestyle, and the preservation of the eGC is an unexplored territory. This article provides an overview of the eGC's importance for health and disease and describes perspectives of nutritional therapy for the prevention of the eGC's pathogenic destruction. It is concluded that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, as well as healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and the time management of eating, might show promise for preserving eGC health and, thus, the health of the cardiovascular system."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Glucose monitoring has evolved from self-monitoring of blood glucose to glycated hemoglobin, and the latest continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). A key challenge to adoption of CGM for management of diabetes in Asia is the lack of regional CGM recommendations. Hence, thirteen diabetes-specialists from eight Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries/regions convened to formulate evidence-based, APAC-specific CGM recommendations for individuals with diabetes. We defined CGM metrics/targets and developed 13 guiding-statements on use of CGM in: (1) people with diabetes on intensive insulin therapy, and (2) people with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin with/without glucose lowering drugs. Continual use of CGM is recommended in individuals with diabetes on intensive insulin therapy and suboptimal glycemic control, or at high risk of problematic hypoglycemia. Continual/intermittent CGM may also be considered in individuals with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin regimen and with suboptimal glycemic control. In this paper, we provided guidance for optimizing CGM in special populations/situations, including elderly, pregnancy, Ramadan-fasting, newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, and comorbid renal disease. Statements on remote CGM, and stepwise interpretation of CGM data were also developed. Two Delphi surveys were conducted to rate the agreement on statements. The current APAC-specific CGM recommendations provide useful guidance for optimizing use of CGM in the region."

The precursor to diabetes is obesity, which currently threatens the Department of Defense's ability to retain and recruit adequate service members. Intermittent fasting may be an adjunct for prevention of obesity and diabetes in the armed forces.",
      "OBJECTIVES": "Weight loss and lifestyle modification are long-standing treatments for T2DM. The objective of this review is to compare IF to continuous energy restriction.",
      "METHODS": "PubMed was searched from August 2013 to March 2022 for systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and case series. Inclusion criteria were studies which monitored HbA1C, fasting glucose levels, diagnosis of T2DM, ages 18-75, and a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. Eight articles met these criteria and were selected. These 8 articles were separated into Categories A and B for this review. Category A includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and Category B consists of pilot studies and clinical trials.",
      "RESULTS": "Intermittent fasting proved to have commensurate decreases in HbA1C and BMI compared to the control group, but not to a statistically significant degree. It cannot be said that IF is better than continuous energy restriction.",
      "CONCLUSION": "More research is needed on this topic as 1 in 11 people suffer from T2DM. The benefits of IF are apparent, but there is not enough breadth of research available to affect clinical guidelines."

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) declined in response to IER or PF in 5 of 10 studies, and fasting glucose declined in 5 of 7 studies. In 4 studies, the dosage of glucose-lowering medication could be reduced during IER or PF. Two studies evaluated long-term effects (≥1 year after ending the intervention). The benefits to HbA1c or fasting glucose were generally not sustained over the long term. There are a limited number of studies on IER and PF interventions in patients with T2D. Most were judged to have at least some risk of bias.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 3 months) were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 6 per group) and T2DM was induced by streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, IM). The control group was untreated. Cognitive function was tested (Y-maze, novel object recognition, and elevated plus maze tests) and glucose was assessed. The T2DM rats exhibited significantly higher blood glucose, which is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Compared to the validated animal model of T2DM in rats, various intermittent fasting protocols decreased blood glucose and improved cognitive function. These results indicate that various intermittent fasting protocols may be a potential strategy for managing the hyperglycemia-associated cognitive dysfunction."

      "INTRODUCTION": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing around the world. Although Muslims with a physical illness are exempted from fasting during the month of Ramadan, a great number still choose to fast, often without medical consultations. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of observing Ramadan fasting (RF) on glycaemic control in patients with T2D.",
      "METHODS": "The Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCOhost, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, ProQuest Central and Europe PubMed Central (Medline) databases were searched for relevant studies published between January 2000 and December 2021. Observational studies that examined the changes in body weight (BW) and glucose parameters (glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c] and fasting blood glucose [FBG]), before and after RF among different age groups with T2D were included in the systemic review and meta-analysis. Effect sizes for the tested outcomes were calculated as weighted mean difference (WMD), with their confidence intervals (CI). Quality assessment was examined using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) tool.",
      "RESULTS": "Of the 1592 identified records, 12 studies conducted in Middle Eastern and Asian countries were eligible and included in the quantitative analyses. The quality of the retrieved studies was evaluated and found to range between fair (83%) and good (17%). These 12 studies included 5554 participants of whom 54% were males and 46% were females. Our pooled analysis demonstrated that HbA1c and FBG levels significantly decreased after RF when compared to the pre-fasting levels (WMD = 0.55 mg/dl, 95% CI 0.33-0.77, P < 0.00001, Ι",
      "CONCLUSION": "The impact of RF on adult patients with T2D is associated with favorable outcomes. However, future studies should evaluate data from young adults separately. In addition, it is essential to identify the effects of the number of fasting days (level of exposure), diet, level of physical activity and sleeping pattern on optimal glycaemic control. This information could be utilized by medical professionals as a non-pharmacological therapeutic method for management of diabetes in patients who are willing to practice fasting during Ramadan and other months of the year.",

      "SUMMARY": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a huge challenge for global public health systems. Currently, healthcare policies advocate the prevention of the onset and progression of T2DM by improving individual lifestyles. The increasing benefits of intermittent fasting (IF) as a dietary intervention have been elucidated. However, the beneficial effects of IF in T2DM remain inconclusive. We demonstrated the physiological mechanisms underlying the positive effects of IF in T2DM. IF could trigger metabolic transformation to improve systemic metabolism and induce tissue-specific metabolic adaptations through alterations in the gut microbiota, adipose tissue remodeling, correction of circadian rhythm disturbances, and increased autophagy in peripheral tissues. The efficacy and safety of IF regimens in clinical applications carry a risk of hypoglycemia and require monitoring of blood glucose and timely adjustment of medications. However, there is limited evidence of a positive effect of IF in weight loss and improvement of glycemic variables. Overall, IF serves as a promising therapeutic target for T2DM and needs to be established by a large randomized controlled trial."

    "abstract": {
      "OBJECTIVE": "To investigate the safety and feasibility of 3 nonconsecutive days of intermittent fasting (IF) per week over 12 weeks in participants with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.",
      "RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS": "Forty-six people were randomized to an IF or control group. Dietary counseling and continuous glucose monitoring was provided. Coprimary end points were the change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 weeks and a composite end point (weight reduction ≥2%, insulin dose reduction ≥10%, and HbA1c reduction ≥3 mmol/mol).",
      "RESULTS": "The IF group showed a significant HbA1c reduction (-7.3 ± 12.0 mmol/mol) compared with the control group (0.1 ± 6.1 mmol/mol) over 12 weeks (P = 0.012). The coprimary end point was achieved by 8 people in the IF and none in the control group (P < 0.001). No severe hypoglycemia occurred.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "IF is a safe and feasible dietary option to ameliorate glycemic control while reducing total daily insulin dose and body weight in insulin-treated people with type 2 diabetes."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "One of the most important components of treatment for diabetic patients is diet and healthy nutrition therapy. Calorie restriction is effective and without cost increases its appeal for both patients and physicians. Unfortunately, continuous calorie restriction is a difficult method. For this reason, alternative calorie restriction methods, such as intermittent fasting (IF), have been investigated by some researchers.",
      "METHODS": "IF refers to a wide range of diet programmes covering periods of eating and fasting, which vary according to the different regimens. In this article, first, some general information will enable us to understand the concept of IF, and then scientific evidence with respect to IF applications in diabetes will be discussed in detail. Thereafter our clinical experience will be summarised, finally, the author will try to answer the question \"are the IF applications beneficial or harmful for diabetic patients?\"",
      "RESULTS": "Considering animal studies, epidemiological studies, pilot studies, clinical experiences and a small number of randomized controlled trials conducted so far, it seems possible to say that the beneficial effects of IF for diabetes patients are greater than potential harms. However, there are not yet enough studies with a high level of evidence to recommend IF as a routine part of the treatment in patients with diabetes.",
      "DISCUSSION": "It is necessary to show which IF regimen is safe and effective, how often and for how long, for diabetic patients. This seems possible with well-designed randomized controlled trials focusing on long-term clinical outcomes and eliminating confounding factors. This will make the answer clearer."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "The practice of intermittent fasting continues to grow as a widely practiced diet trend due to its feasibility and reported high success rate. By practicing intermittent fasting, levels of sirtuin proteins (SIRTs), also known as the longevity protein, rise in the body and bring numerous health benefits. Currently, seven SIRTs have been described in humans in different locations of the cell with a wide variety of corresponding functions including gene transcription, DNA repair, and protection against oxidative damage. SIRT activators, such as resveratrol found in red wine, are also commonly consumed to amplify the health benefits associated with protection against diabetes and age-related disease processes. The purpose of this review is to explore the interaction of intermittent fasting on SIRT levels and how the increase in these proteins impacts age-related disease processes. The understanding of SIRTs is continuously evolving as more interactions and SIRT-specific activators are being revealed. New discoveries are crucial for forming potential therapeutics that delay many common diseases and promote healthy living."

    "title": "Role of Intermittent Fasting in the Management of Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent disease in the modern society. It can be defined as a group of metabolic diseases marked by chronic hyperglycemia arising from defects in insulin secretion or resistance to insulin action, or both. Its predecessor, prediabetes, is also an important entity, and its management is essential to prevent its progression to DM. Together, these entities burden global health and the world economy, and therefore, prevention and management are key to improving global health and reducing the financial burden on the world economy. Comprehensive lifestyle modification has been proven to be a safe and effective method for preventing the progression of prediabetes and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, exercise, and diets such as low-carbohydrate one, Mediterranean, and very low calorie diets are traditionally recommended. These particular diets aim to attain calorie deficits and thus induce weight loss. Intermittent fasting (IF) is one such diet that focuses more on the timing of calorie consumption. However, there are several methods of achieving this, which are highlighted in this review. IF has been shown to promote weight loss, reduce insulin resistance, improve glycemic control and lower the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. However, little literature is available regarding the use of IF in managing DM. This review intends to elucidate the role of intermittent fasting in preventing and treating DM, including its benefits and limitations. From the various studies reviewed in this article, it can be deduced that intermittent fasting can achieve suitable glycemic targets and weight control."

    "title": "A Chinese medical nutrition therapy diet accompanied by intermittent energy restriction alleviates type 2 diabetes by enhancing pancreatic islet function and regulating gut microbiota composition.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Medicine food homologous (MFH) plants and wholegrains have gained increasing attention for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of intermittent energy restriction (IER) in T2D management. However, there are few studies that report intermittent use of a low-calorie pre-prepared food including MFH plants and wholegrains in T2D. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Chinese Medical Nutrition Therapy (CMNT), a MFH plants and wholegrains diet accompanied by IER, on glycemic control and potential mechanism. Ten-week-old diabetic db/db mice were randomly divided into CMNT group (feeding low-calorie mouse CMNT diet in day 1-4 and ad libitum regular chow for up to 7 days per cycle) and control group (ad libitum access to regular chow). The results showed that CMNT reduced fasting blood glucose, improved glucose tolerance with higher insulin secretion, attenuated macrophage infiltration, promoted β-cell proliferation of pancreatic islets, and increased diabetes-improving microbiota (Bacteroides, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Coprococcus_1) in db/db mice. Additionally, we performed a pilot study evaluating CMNT in thirty-nine T2D patients without obesity. Participants with T2D randomly assigned to two groups: CMNT group (receiving a consecutive 5-day low-calorie human CMNT diet with 10 days of habitual eating per cycle for 90 days) and control group (continuing on a normal diet). We observed an improvement in glycemic control in CMNT group with significant reduction in HbA1c, fasting glucose, 2 h postprandial blood glucose but control group were not affected. After CMNT intervention, the abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and genus Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Roseburia were significantly higher than baseline in T2D patient, which were closely associated with glycemic control. These findings suggested that CMNT is a promising nutritional intervention approach in diabetes management."

    "title": "Effects of Diet, Lifestyle, Chrononutrition and Alternative Dietary Interventions on Postprandial Glycemia and Insulin Resistance.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "As years progress, we are found more often in a postprandial than a postabsorptive state. Chrononutrition is an integral part of metabolism, pancreatic function, and hormone secretion. Eating most calories and carbohydrates at lunch time and early afternoon, avoiding late evening dinner, and keeping consistent number of daily meals and relative times of eating occasions seem to play a pivotal role for postprandial glycemia and insulin sensitivity. Sequence of meals and nutrients also play a significant role, as foods of low density such as vegetables, salads, or soups consumed first, followed by protein and then by starchy foods lead to ameliorated glycemic and insulin responses. There are several dietary schemes available, such as intermittent fasting regimes, which may improve glycemic and insulin responses. Weight loss is important for the treatment of insulin resistance, and it can be achieved by many approaches, such as low-fat, low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean-style diets, etc. Lifestyle interventions with small weight loss (7-10%), 150 min of weekly moderate intensity exercise and behavioral therapy approach can be highly effective in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes. Similarly, decreasing carbohydrates in meals also improves significantly glycemic and insulin responses, but the extent of this reduction should be individualized, patient-centered, and monitored. Alternative foods or ingredients, such as vinegar, yogurt, whey protein, peanuts and tree nuts should also be considered in ameliorating postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. This review aims to describe the available evidence about the effects of diet, chrononutrition, alternative dietary interventions and exercise on postprandial glycemia and insulin resistance."

      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting has become popular in recent years and is controversially presented as a possible therapeutic adjunct. A bibliographic review of the literature on intermittent fasting and obesity, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis was carried out. The scientific quality of the methodology and the results obtained were evaluated in pairs. Intermittent fasting has beneficial effects on the lipid profile, and it is associated with weight loss and a modification of the distribution of abdominal fat in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes as well as an improvement in the control of glycemic levels. In patients with multiple sclerosis, the data available are too scarce to draw any firm conclusions, but it does appear that intermittent fasting may be a safe and feasible intervention. However, it is necessary to continue investigating its long-term effects since so far, the studies carried out are small and of short duration."

      "SUMMARY": "The prevalence of obesity in the United States approaches half of the adult population. The COVID-19 pandemic endangers the health of obese individuals. In addition, the metabolic syndrome poses a challenge to the health of obese adults. Bariatric surgery and diet restore metabolic homeostasis in obese individuals; however, it is still unclear which strategy is most effective. For example, intermittent fasting improves insulin sensitivity and diet alone decreases visceral adipose tissue at a disproportionately high rate compared to weight loss. Bariatric surgery causes rapid remission of type 2 diabetes and increases incretins for long-term remission of insulin resistance before meaningful weight loss has occurred. Malabsorptive surgeries have provided insight into the mechanism of altering metabolic parameters, but strong evidence to determine the duration of their effects is yet to be established. When determining the best method of weight loss, metabolic parameters, target weight loss, and risk-benefit analysis must be considered carefully. In this review, we address the pros and cons for the optimal way to restore metabolic homeostasis."

      "AIM": "To assess the effect of medical nutritional therapy (MNT) provided by dieticians on medical and clinical outcomes for adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "To compare effectiveness of MNT administered monthly to MNT administered once in 03 months.",
      "METHOD": "The study was conducted at the Department of Endocrinology in a tertiary care hospital. 98 men and women of the age group above 18 years were recruited in the study. 49 consenting individuals were randomly assigned to each of the 02 groups namely Group A and Group B. Group A consisted of 02 visits with dietician (including the initial visit) in the first month and thereafter every monthly. Group B consisted of initial visit with the dietician and there after every 03 monthly. An additional 49 adults with type 2 Diabetes mellitus at one site who had no facility for a contact with dietician were included as a comparison group.Medical outcome measures including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum lipid levels were compared and analysed. Clinical outcomes included Body weight, Height and Body mass index (BMI).Data was collected at the entry to the study and at 03 and 06 months interval.",
      "RESULT": "In our study, the baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1C, total cholesterol and BMI was more or less similar in all 3 groups. There was a sustained decrease in all the four parameters in Group A which received the maximum nutritional therapy over a period of 06 months (A mean decrease of FPG 15.2 mg/dL, HbA1C 0.59%, total cholesterol 19.6 mg/dL, BMI 0.5 kg/m2 from baseline at 03 months and a mean decrease of FPG 33.4 mg/dL, HbA1C 1.24%, total cholesterol 40.8 mg/dL, BMI 1.1 kg/m2 from baseline at 06 months was seen). However, in Group B which received intermitted nutritional therapy, the decrease in these parameters were observed initially but over a period of 06 months, they increased to more or less near the baseline value months (A mean decrease of FPG 12.9 mg/dL, HbA1C 0.73%, total cholesterol 16.1 mg/dL, BMI 0.5 kg/m2 from baseline at 03 months but a mean increase of FPG 3.2 mg/dL and a mean decrease of HbA1C 0.24%, total cholesterol of 4.3 mg/dL and BMI 0.15 kg/m2 from baseline at 06 months was seen). In Group C which had no means of access to nutritional therapy, there was a subtle decrease in FPG and gradual increase in HbA1C, total cholesterol and BMI at 03 months but all four parameters increased significantly higher than the baseline value at the end of 06 months months (A mean decrease of FPG 6.2 mg/dL and mean increase of HbA1C 0.31%, total cholesterol 16.0 mg/dL, BMI 0.3 kg/m2 from baseline at 03 months and a mean increase of FPG 5.9 mg/dL, HbA1C 0.73%, total cholesterol 31.1 mg/dL, BMI 0.81 kg/m2 from baseline at 06 months was seen).",
      "CONCLUSION": "Our study has clearly indicated that medical nutritional therapy is of great importance in the holistic management of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus in adults. MNT has got the advantage of not only maintaining a strict glycemic control (in terms of FPG and HbA1C reduction) but also in the lowering of cholesterol and BMI which are the main contributors to cardiovascular (CVD) events among people with type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Also, people who were given frequent MNT had a clear advantage over those who received intermittent MNT in terms of all the measured parameters."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Type 2 diabetes can potentially be prevented by targeted lifestyle and weight loss interventions. Time restricted eating (TRE) is a form of intermittent fasting that has emerged as a novel diet strategy to reduce body weight and improve glycaemic control. TRE involves eating within a certain window of time (usually 4 to 10 h), and water-fasting for the remaining hours of the day. The purpose of this review is to summarize the effects of TRE on body weight and markers of glycaemic control in human subjects. We also aim to provide mechanistic insights into the effect of TRE on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Results to date reveal that TRE produces mild weight loss (1%-4% from baseline) and energy restriction, when food consumption is restricted to 4-10 h/day. TRE also reduces fasting insulin and improves insulin sensitivity in individuals with prediabetes and those with obesity. Moreover, TRE improves glucose tolerance and decreases serum glucose excursions. The possible mechanisms underlying these benefits include increased autophagic flux, mild elevations in ketone bodies, a reduction in oxidative stress, and the stimulation of β-cell responsiveness. While these preliminary results offer promise for the use of TRE in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, larger and longer-term human trials will be needed to confirm these findings."

      "RESULTS": "Of 84 retrieved studies, 5 met our inclusion criteria. Of these, four studies comprising 355 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Based on changes in HbA1c (-0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 0.16) and fasting plasma glucose (-0.27, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.22), IF and CERD had similar effects on glycemic control. Moreover, IF had a better effect on weight loss (-1.70, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.11 kg). Patients in both groups experienced similar improvements in fasting insulin and lipid profile as well as similar hypoglycemic events.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "IF is a safe diet pattern and could be implemented for patients with T2DM or metabolic syndrome. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to verify the effectiveness and safety of IF in patients with T2DM."

Intermittent fasting (IF) has recently emerged as a viable alternative to daily CR to reduce risk markers of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The majority of trials have shown that IF provides similar metabolic and weight benefits to CR, although a few suggest that IF maybe superior to CR. The type of fasting protocol that is employed varies widely and could underpin the divergence in study outcomes. This review will discuss the findings of currently available IF versus CR trials, the protocol differences that exist between studies, as well as the gaps that still exist in the field, and finally will highlight upcoming studies that will further our understanding of the metabolic effectiveness of IF diets for metabolic health."

      "INTRODUCTION": "Ketogenic diets have shown to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study investigated the safety, tolerability, and effects on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes of an exogenous ketone monoester (KE) capable of inducing fasting-like elevations in serum β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) without the need for caloric or carbohydrate restriction.",
      "METHODS": "Twenty one participants (14 men and 7 women, aged 45 ± 11 years) with insulin-independent type 2 diabetes, and unchanged hypoglycaemic medication for the previous 6 months, were recruited for this non-randomised interventional study. Participants wore intermittent scanning glucose monitors (IS-GM) for a total of 6 weeks and were given 25 ml of KE 3 times daily for 4 weeks. Serum electrolytes, acid-base status, and βHB concentrations were measured weekly and cardiovascular risk markers were measured before and after the intervention. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, with the secondary endpoint being glycaemic control.",
      "RESULTS": "The 21 participants consumed a total of 1,588 drinks (39.7 litres) of KE over the course of the intervention. Adverse reactions were mild and infrequent, including mild nausea, headache, and gastric discomfort following fewer than 0.5% of the drinks. Serum electrolyte concentrations, acid-base status, and renal function remained normal throughout the study. Compared to baseline, exogenous ketosis induced a significant decrease in all glycaemic control markers, including fructosamine (335 ± 60 μmol/L to 290 ± 49 μmol/L, ",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Constant ketone monoester consumption over 1 month was safe, well tolerated, and improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes."

      "SUMMARY": "Insulin resistance is the hallmark of Type 2 Diabetes and is still an unmet medical need. Insulin resistance lies at the crossroads of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, weight loss and exercise resistance, heart disease, stroke, depression, and brain health. Insulin resistance is purely nutrition related, with a typical molecular disease food intake pattern. The insulin resistant state is accessible by TyG as the appropriate surrogate marker, which is found to lead the personalized molecular hepatic nutrition system for highly efficient insulin resistance remission. Treating insulin resistance with a molecular nutrition-centered approach shifts the treatment paradigm of Type 2 Diabetes from management to cure. This allows remission within five months, with a high efficiency rate of 85%. With molecular intermittent fasting a very efficient treatment for prediabetes and metabolic syndrome is possible, improving the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL) state and enabling the body to lose weight in a sustainable manner."

      "METHODS": "A rat IR model was established through collaboration of a high-fat diet with streptozotocin (STZ) injection. 8 rats were treated with intermittent FT. A positive control group was treated with metformin (MET). Mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured and induced into adipocytes in vitro, and were used as the cellular IR model. Blood insulin, glucose, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR index were determined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting were used to detect inflammatory markers. Oil Red O staining determined the lipid accumulation. An NLRP3 inflammasome agonist served to investigate the effects of FT on IR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",
      "RESULTS": "The high levels of blood insulin, glucose, and HOMA-IR induced by high-fat diet and STZ were significantly decreased by FT. The FT also reduced the level of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, caspase-1, and increased the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and IRS2 in both the rat models and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, FT significantly relieved lipid accumulation in the liver of rats. Application of NLRP3 inflammasome agonist weakened the effect of FT on IR in the IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "These results suggest that FT can ameliorate the high-fat diet-and STZ-induced IR in rats through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome."

    "title": "Diets and drugs for weight loss and health in obesity - An update.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Numerous combinations of diets and pharmacological agents, including lifestyle changes, have been launched to treat obesity. There are still ambiguities regarding the efficacies of different approaches despite many clinical trials and the use of animal models to study physiological mechanisms in weight management and obesity comorbidities, Here, we present an update on promising diets and pharmacological aids. Literature published after the year 2005 was searched in PubMed, Medline and Google scholar. Among recommended diets are low-fat (LF) and low-carbohydrate (LC) diets, in addition to the Mediterranean diet and the intermittent fasting approach, all of which presumably being optimized by adequate contents of dietary fibers. A basic point for weight loss is to adopt a diet that creates a permanently negative and acceptable energy balance, and prolonged dietary adherence is a crucial factor. As for pharmacological aids, obese patients with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance seem to benefit from LC diet combined with a GLP-1 agonist, e.g. semaglutide, which may improve glycemic control, stimulate satiety, and suppress appetite. The lipase inhibitor orlistat is still used to maintain a low-fat approach, which may be favorable e.g. in hypercholesterolemia. The bupropion-naltrexone-combination appears promising for interruption of the vicious cycle of addictive over-eating. Successful weight loss seems to improve almost all biomarkers of obesity comorbidities. Until more support for specific strategies is available, clinicians should recommend an adapted lifestyle, and when necessary, a drug combination tailored to individual needs and comorbidities. Different diets may change hormonal secretion, gut-brain signaling, and influence hunger, satiety and energy expenditure. Further research is needed to clarify mechanisms and how such knowledge can be used in weight management."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "research exploring the effects of food timing and frequency on health and disease is currently ongoing. While there is an increasing body of scientific literature showing the potential health benefits of intermittent fasting (IF) in laboratory settings and in animals, studies regarding IF on humans are limited. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the relationship between the feeding/fasting time window and metabolic outcomes among adult individuals.",
      "METHODS": "dietary and demographic data of 1936 adult subjects living in the south of Italy were examined. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were administered to determine the period of time between the first and the last meal of a typical day. Subjects were then divided into those with a time feeding window lasting more than 10 h, within 8 h (TRF-8) and within 10 h.",
      "RESULTS": "after adjustment for potential confounding factors related to eating habits (such as adherence to the Mediterranean diet, having breakfast/dinner), TRF-10 was inversely associated with being overweight/obese (OR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07), hypertension (OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.45), and dyslipidemias (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.63), while TRF-8 only with being overweight/obese (OR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.15) and hypertension (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.60). No associations were found with type-2 diabetes.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "individuals with a restricted feeding time window were less likely to be overweight, obese and hypertensive. Further studies are needed to clearly validate the results of the present study."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "The IDF-DAR guidance was most recently updated this year. The most notable change is the moving to a scoring system from a tabulated risk categorization to determine and classify the risk of harm from fasting derived from an online survey. This change may be appealing and is welcomed. However, such a system and the methodology underpinning it is not without limitations. This commentary highlights some of these limitations and the associated limited safe options available to individuals with diabetes desiring to fast during Ramadan. Overlooked clinical considerations that deserve formal recognition include the role of technology (aspects relating to glucose monitoring and/or insulin delivery) and previous experience of safe Ramadan fasting. Further, duration of fast (which can almost double in temperate regions from winter to summer) needs greater emphasis. We also advocate separate scoring systems for people with type 1 diabetes and complex type 2 diabetes. The guidance acknowledges fasting is an individual's decision, however the general message needs to be more person-centred and currently only presents a binary approach to fasting - all or nothing choices. We propose and discuss addition options including, trial fasting of voluntary fasts, starting the fast and terminating due to health and/or safety, intermittent fasting and winter fasting."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND & AIMS": "The first-line treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is weight reduction. Several diets have been proposed, with various effects specifically on liver steatosis. This trial compared the effects of intermittent calorie restriction (the 5:2 diet) and a low-carb high-fat diet (LCHF) on reduction of hepatic steatosis.",
      "METHODS": "We conducted an open-label randomised controlled trial that included 74 patients with NAFLD randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to 12 weeks' treatment with either a LCHF or 5:2 diet, or general lifestyle advice from a hepatologist (standard of care; SoC). The primary outcome was reduction of hepatic steatosis as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Secondary outcomes included transient elastography, insulin resistance, blood lipids, and anthropometrics.",
      "RESULTS": "The LCHF and 5:2 diets were both superior to SoC treatment in reducing steatosis (absolute reduction: LCHF: -7.2% [95% CI = -9.3 to -5.1], 5:2: -6.1% [95% CI = -8.1 to -4.2], SoC: -3.6% [95% CI = -5.8 to -1.5]) and body weight (LCHF: -7.3 kg [95% CI = -9.6 to -5.0]; 5:2: -7.4 kg [95% CI = -8.7 to -6.0]; SoC: -2.5 kg [95% CI =-3.5 to -1.5]. There was no difference between 5:2 and LCHF (",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "The LCHF and 5:2 diets were more effective in reducing steatosis and body weight in patients with NAFLD than SoC, suggesting dietary advice can be tailored to meet individual preferences.",
      "LAY SUMMARY": "For a person with obesity who suffers from fatty liver, weight loss through diet can be an effective treatment to improve the condition of the liver. Many popular diets that are recommended for weight reduction, such as high-fat diets and diets based on intermittent fasting, have not had their effects on the liver directly evaluated. This study shows that both a low-carb high-fat and the 5:2 diet are effective in treating fatty liver caused by obesity.",

    "title": "Modulating the Microbiota as a Therapeutic Intervention for Type 2 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Mounting evidence suggested that the gut microbiota has a significant role in the metabolism and disease status of the host. In particular, Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), which has a complex etiology that includes obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation, is modulated by the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites. Current literature supports that unbalanced gut microbial composition (dysbiosis) is a risk factor for T2D. In this review, we critically summarize the recent findings regarding the role of gut microbiota in T2D. Beyond these associative studies, we focus on the causal relationship between microbiota and T2D established using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or probiotic supplementation, and the potential underlying mechanisms such as byproducts of microbial metabolism. These microbial metabolites are small molecules that establish communication between microbiota and host cells. We critically summarize the associations between T2D and microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO). Additionally, we comment on how host genetic architecture and the epigenome influence the microbial composition and thus how the gut microbiota may explain part of the missing heritability of T2D found by GWAS analysis. We also discuss future directions in this field and how approaches such as FMT, prebiotics, and probiotics supplementation are being considered as potential therapeutics for T2D."

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine and metabolic diseases affecting women of childbearing age. It is associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The effects of TRF on PCOS patients remains undefined, here we investigated the impact of TRF on women with anovulatory PCOS.",
      "METHODS": "Eighteen PCOS women aged between 18 and 31 with anovulation participated in a 6-week trial which were divided into two consecutive periods: (1) 1-week baseline weight stabilization period and (2) 5-week TRF period. Fifteen participants completed the study. Changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), Waist-to-Hip Ratio, skeletal muscle mass, body fat mass (BFM), body fat percentage (BF%), visceral fat area (VFA), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), LH/FSH, total testosterone (TT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI), fasting glucose, fasting insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), area under the curve (AUC) for insulin (AUCIns), area under the curve (AUC) for glucose (AUCGlu), AUCIns/AUCGlu Ratio, lipids, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), menstrual cycle and eating behaviors were evaluated.",
      "RESULTS": "Significant changes in body weight, BMI, BFM, BF%, VFA, TT, SHBG, FAI, FINS, HOMA-IR, AUCIns, AUCIns/AUCGlu Ratio, ALT, hsCRP and IGF-1 were found after the TRF period. An improvement in menstrual cycle irregularity was detected in 73.3% (11/15) patients.",

    "abstract": {
      "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS": "Homo sapiens evolved under conditions of intermittent food availability and prolonged fasting between meals. Periods of fasting are important for recovery from meal-induced oxidative and metabolic stress, and tissue repair. Constant high energy-density food availability in present-day society contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic diseases, including diabetes and its complications, with intermittent fasting (IF) and energy restriction shown to improve metabolic health. We have previously demonstrated that IF prevents the development of diabetic retinopathy in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes (db/db); however the mechanisms of fasting-induced health benefits and fasting-induced risks for individuals with diabetes remain largely unknown. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a nutrient-sensing deacetylase, is downregulated in diabetes. In this study, the effect of SIRT1 stimulation by IF, fasting-mimicking cell culture conditions (FMC) or pharmacological treatment using SRT1720 was evaluated on systemic and retinal metabolism, systemic and retinal inflammation and vascular and bone marrow damage.",
      "METHODS": "The effects of IF were modelled in vivo using db/db mice and in vitro using bovine retinal endothelial cells or rat retinal neuroglial/precursor R28 cell line serum starved for 24 h. mRNA expression was analysed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). SIRT1 activity was measured via histone deacetylase activity assay. NR1H3 (also known as liver X receptor alpha [LXRα]) acetylation was measured via western blot analysis.",
      "RESULTS": "IF increased Sirt1 mRNA expression in mouse liver and retina when compared with non-fasted animals. IF also increased SIRT1 activity eightfold in mouse retina while FMC increased SIRT1 activity and expression in retinal endothelial cells when compared with control. Sirt1 expression was also increased twofold in neuronal retina progenitor cells (R28) after FMC treatment. Moreover, FMC led to SIRT1-mediated LXRα deacetylation and subsequent 2.4-fold increase in activity, as measured by increased mRNA expression of the genes encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter (Abca1 and Abcg1). These changes were reduced when retinal endothelial cells expressing a constitutively acetylated LXRα mutant were tested. Increased SIRT1/LXR/ABC-mediated cholesterol export resulted in decreased retinal endothelial cell cholesterol levels. Direct activation of SIRT1 by SRT1720 in db/db mice led to a twofold reduction of diabetes-induced inflammation in the retina and improved diabetes-induced visual function impairment, as measured by electroretinogram and optokinetic response. In the bone marrow, there was prevention of diabetes-induced myeloidosis and decreased inflammatory cytokine expression.",
      "CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION": "Taken together, activation of SIRT1 signalling by IF or through pharmacological activation represents an effective therapeutic strategy that provides a mechanistic link between the advantageous effects associated with fasting regimens and prevention of microvascular and bone marrow dysfunction in diabetes."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Ramadan is the 9th month of the lunar calendar during which Muslims abstain from food and drink between dawn and sunset for 30 consecutive days. Ramadan fasting is observed by all healthy Muslim adults, as well many Muslims with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Hypoglycemic events (HE) are a serious complication associated with diabetes management and are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Conflicting results have been reported concerning the incidence of HE among people with T2DM observing Ramadan fasting. This review summarizes available scientific evidence on the occurrence of HE and the effects of different moderators on the incidence of HE among patients with T2DM during Ramadan. We conducted a systematic review of available observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for patients with T2DM who fasted during Ramadan, with HE as the primary outcome. Ten databases were searched for relevant studies from inception until October 31, 2020. In total, 68 studies (35 RCTs and 33 observational studies) met the inclusion criteria. Non-sulfonylureas hypoglycemic medications showed superior effects in lowering the incidence of HE over sulfonylureas hypoglycemic medications. Variable moderators were associated with experiencing HE during Ramadan in both observational studies and RCTs, including sex, geographical location, body anthropometric indicators, season, dietary behaviors, fasting duration, time since diagnosis, and pre-fasting education. This comprehensive systematic review covered the largest number of observational and clinical studies investigating the impact of Ramadan on HE among patients with T2DM. The study highlights the significance of different moderators that influence the effect of Ramadan fasting on HE, including dietary behaviors, fasting time duration, sex, season, country, pre-fasting education, age, and time since diagnosis. The study also highlighted the impact of different hypoglycemic medications on HE and noted the superiority of non-sulfonylureas over sulfonylureas hypoglycemic medications in lowering the risk for hypoglycemia in people with T2DM during Ramadan fasting."

Fasting for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is generally considered too risky. However, the ability and possibility to change from carbohydrate- to ketone-based fuel supply might be relevant for individuals with T1D. The aim of this patient-led research was to investigate the feasibility, benefit, and safety of a 7-d multimodal fasting intervention in individuals with T1D.",
      "METHODS": "This was a non-randomized controlled pilot study, with 20 participants with T1D and 10 without the disease. Data acquisition took place before, after, and 4 mo after the intervention and daily during intervention.",
      "RESULTS": "Of the individuals with T1D, 19 finished fasting. A mean β-hydroxybutyrate as representative ketone body increased to 2.8 ± 1.9 mmol/L on day 7; whereas average glucose remained between 4.9 (±1.5) and 7.5 (±2.3) mmol/L (89 ± 27 and 136 ± 40 mg/dL). Mean daily insulin dose was adjusted from 24.4 (3-50) IU on the day before fasting to 7.6 (0-26.7) IU on day 7. Quality of life (WHO-5) normalized from 54 (±4.4) to 68.8 (±15; P = 0.01) after fasting. There was a decrease from before until the follow-up 4 mo later of weight from 77.6 (±20.4) to 76.6 (±20.9) kg (P = 0.023) and for body mass index from 27.68 (±7.04) to 26.74 (±7.15) kg/m",

    "title": "Intermittent fasting: is there a role in the treatment of diabetes? A review of the literature and guide for primary care physicians.",
    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Type 2 Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia that causes numerous complications with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. The disorder is primarily due to insulin resistance particularly in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In this review, we detail the hormonal mechanisms leading to the development of diabetes and discuss whether intermittent fasting should be considered as an alternative, non-medicinal treatment option for patients with this disorder.",
      "METHODS": "We searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases for review articles, clinical trials, and case series related to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and intermittent fasting. Articles were carefully reviewed and included based on relevance to our topic. We excluded abstracts and any non-English articles.",
      "RESULTS": "The majority of the available research demonstrates that intermittent fasting is effective at reducing body weight, decreasing fasting glucose, decreasing fasting insulin, reducing insulin resistance, decreasing levels of leptin, and increasing levels of adiponectin. Some studies found that patients were able to reverse their need for insulin therapy during therapeutic intermittent fasting protocols with supervision by their physician.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Current evidence suggests that intermittent fasting is an effective non-medicinal treatment option for type 2 diabetes. More research is needed to delineate the effects of intermittent fasting from weight loss. Physicians should consider educating themselves regarding the benefits of intermittent fasting. Diabetic patients should consult their physician prior to beginning an intermittent fasting regimen in order to allow for appropriate oversight and titration of the patients medication regimen during periods of fasting."

    "abstract": {
      "UNLABELLED": "Physiological impact of the intermittent or prolonged fasting is known from various studies on healthy subjects. However, data on impact of fasting on biochemical and biometric parameters in people with diabetes is building up. Safety of Ramadan fasting has always been assessed after Ramadan. This study looked into the immediate effect of fasting during the fasting days compared to time before and after the fasting month.",
      "METHODS": "This is an observational study. We looked into people with biometric and biochemical records before Ramadan, and we followed them up during and after Ramadan prospectively. We were aiming for assessing the biochemical and biometric changes for people with diabetes during Ramadan in comparison to pre-and post Ramadan. As well as the differences between these measures according to type and treatment of diabetes in those who fasted as well as in those who did not fast during Ramadan.",
      "RESULTS": "Total of 342 patients were recruited to the study. All were patients with diabetes at a mild to moderate risk of complications if fasted. Majority were males 52.3% (n = 180), while females were 47.7% (n = 162). Most of the results showed a U shape between Pre-Ramadan, During Ramadan and Post-Ramadan periods. there was a modest but significant reduction in weight but regained after Ramadan.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Our study suggests that for many people with diabetes fasting is not associated with an increased risk to their glycemic control, their weight and/or their blood pressure. Indeed, what is seen is marginal benefit or no change in all parameters. This stratifies the ongoing recommendation that allows patients with categorized as low risk to fast Ramadan or non-Ramadan days whenever desired."

      "BACKGROUND": "The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among the worldwide population has been associated with a range of adverse health consequences such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic abnormalities that occur more commonly in overweight individuals. Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a dietary approach used for weight loss and overall health. TRF may be an option for those subjects who struggle with extreme restriction diets with foods that generally do not belong to an individual's habits.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of TRF on body composition and the association of weight loss with metabolic and cardiovascular risks in obese middle-aged women.",
      "METHODS": "A non-randomized controlled clinical trial was performed over 3 months in obese women (TRF group, n = 20, BMI 32.53 ± 1.13 vs. Control n = 12, BMI 34.55 ± 1.20). The TRF protocol adopted was 16 h without any energy intake followed by 8 h of normal food intake.",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES": "Anthropometric measurements, body composition, blood biomarkers, cardiovascular risk in 30 years (CVDRisk30y), and quality of life were evaluated at baseline and after the 3 months.",
      "RESULTS": "TRF was effective in reducing weight (~ 4 kg), BMI, % of body fat (%BF), waist circumference from baseline without changes in blood biomarkers associated with MetS. TRF promoted a reduction in CVDRisk30y (12%) wich was moderately correlated with %BF (r = 0.62, n = 64, p < 0.001) and %MM (r = - 0.74, n = 64, p < 0.001).",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "TRF protocol reduces body weight without changes in biomarkers related to MetS. In addition, the anthropometric evaluation that predicts %BF and %MM could be used as an approach to follow individuals engaged in the TRF regimen since they correlate with cardiovascular risk."

      "CONTEXT": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has been proposed as a weight-loss strategy with additional cardiometabolic benefits in individuals with obesity. Despite its growing popularity, the effect of IF in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remains unclear.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the metabolic impact of IF compared to standard diet in patients with T2DM.",
      "METHODS": "Embase, PubMed, and clinicaltrials.gov between 1950 and August 12, 2020 were searched for randomized, diet-controlled studies evaluating any IF intervention in adults with T2DM. We examined the impact of IF on weight loss and glucose-lowering by calculating pooled estimates of the absolute differences in body weight and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to a control group using a random-effects model.",
      "RESULTS": "Seven studies (n = 338 participants; mean body mass index [BMI] 35.65, mean baseline HbA1c 8.8%) met our inclusion criteria. IF induced a greater decrease in body weight by -1.89 kg (95% CI, -2.91 to -0.86 kg) compared to a regular diet, with no significant between-study heterogeneity (I2 21.0%, P = .28). The additional weight loss induced by IF was greater in studies with a heavier population (BMI > 36) (-3.43 kg [95% CI, -5.72 to -1.15 kg]) and in studies of shorter duration (≤ 4 months) (-3.73 kg [95% CI, -7.11 to -0.36 kg]). IF was not associated with further reduction in HbA1c compared to a standard diet (HbA1c -0.11% [95% CI, -0.38% to 0.17%]).",
      "CONCLUSION": "Current evidence suggests that IF is associated with greater weight loss in patients with T2DM compared with a standard diet, with a similar impact on glycemic control."

      "SUMMARY": "The global prevalence of metabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes and fatty liver disease, is dramatically increasing. Both genetic and environmental factors are well-known contributors to the development of these diseases and therefore, the study of epigenetics can provide additional mechanistic insight. Dietary interventions, including caloric restriction, intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding, have shown promising improvements in patients' overall metabolic profiles (i.e., reduced body weight, improved glucose homeostasis), and an increasing number of studies have associated these beneficial effects with epigenetic alterations. In this article, we review epigenetic changes involved in both metabolic diseases and dietary interventions in primary metabolic tissues (i.e., adipose, liver, and pancreas) in hopes of elucidating potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for disease prevention and treatment."

      "SUMMARY": "Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) require a long-term dietary strategy for blood glucose management and may benefit from time-restricted eating (TRE, where the duration between the first and last energy intake is restricted to 8-10 h/day). We aimed to determine the feasibility of TRE for individuals with T2D. Participants with T2D (HbA1c >6.5 to <9%, eating window >12 h/day) were recruited to a pre-post, non-randomised intervention consisting of a 2-week Habitual period to establish baseline dietary intake, followed by a 4-weeks TRE intervention during which they were instructed to limit all eating occasions to between 10:00 and 19:00 h on as many days of each week as possible. Recruitment, retention, acceptability, and safety were recorded throughout the study as indicators of feasibility. Dietary intake, glycaemic control, psychological well-being, acceptability, cognitive outcomes, and physiological measures were explored as secondary outcomes. From 594 interested persons, and 27 eligible individuals, 24 participants enrolled and 19 participants (mean ± SD; age: 50 ± 9 years, BMI: 34 ± 5 kg/m"

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is described as an independent risk factor for the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), as well as for insulin resistance (IR). The mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. One of the proposed molecular mechanism is based on the oxygen-sensitive α-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α)-a key regulator of oxygen metabolism. The concept that stabilization of HIF-1α may influence T2DM and IR is supported by cell and animal models. Cell culture studies revealed that both glucose uptake and glycolysis are regulated by HIF-1α. Furthermore, animal models indicated that increased fasting glucose may be caused by a single night with intermittent hypoxia. Moreover, in these models, hypoxia time was correlated with IR. Mice models revealed that inhibition of HIF-1α protein may downregulate fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin level. Administration of superoxide dismutase mimetic resulted in inhibition of HIF-1α protein, catecholamines, and chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced hypertension in a mice model. The hypothesis that hypoxia is an independent risk factor for IR is strengthened by experimentally confirmed improvement of insulin sensitivity among OSA patients treated with the continuous positive airway pressure. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that HIF-1α protein concentration is increased in individuals with OSA. In this literature review, we summarize the current knowledge about HIF-1α in OSA in relation to the possible pathways in which they contribute to metabolic disorders."

    "title": "Time-Restricted Feeding and Potential for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an increasingly popular strategy for weight loss and improved metabolic health. IF regimes involve deliberate implementation of fasting windows ranging from 12 to 72 hours. During these fasting windows, individuals reduce their caloric intake by 75% to 100%. Such strategies show promise and are increasingly socially popular, but many effects are not completely understood. Specifically, the effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF), a specific form of IF in which participants undergo daily fasting periods lasting about 16 hours, is among the most popular yet under-studied regimens. This review finds that TRF may produce mild weight loss and improved function of insulin. TRF also likely produces cardiovascular effects, such as decreased blood pressure and fasting blood triglycerides. TRF, like other forms of IF, may encourage fat loss specifically when combined with exercise. The manuscripts identified in this narrative literature review were analyzed for the potential benefit for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and limitations of summarized content were noted. While these studies support some suspected benefits of TRF, they also legitimize the need for future TRF studies, since conclusions are greatly limited by a paucity of evidence."

      "METHODS": "This cohort study involved 98 Yemeni male subjects aged 30-70 years old: 30 Type 2 DM, 37 FDRs of Type 2 diabetic patients, and 31 healthy control subjects. Subjects' body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure (BP) were measured, and venous blood samples were collected twice: the first samples were collected a couple of days prior to Ramadan fasting (baseline) and the second samples after 3 weeks of fasting.",
      "RESULTS": "Ramadan fasting did not affect BMI, WC, and BP in Type 2 DM and their FDRs with respect to the baseline levels prior to Ramadan, whereas triglyceride and cholesterol were borderline significantly decreased in Type 2 DM with no effect in FDRs. Fasting blood glucose was not affected in Type 2 DM but was significantly increased in FDRs and control groups, whereas glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was slightly decreased in Type 2 DM, FDRs, and healthy controls. C-peptide, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly increased in Type 2 DM and FDRs, with no effect in the control group, whereas ",
      "CONCLUSION": "Ramadan intermittent fasting decreased adiponectin and increased leptin, LAR, insulin, and insulin resistance in both Type 2 DM and FDRs as well as decreased GH in both FDRs and healthy controls and increased hs-CRP in healthy controls. Moreover, Ramadan intermittent fasting neither worsens a patient's glycemic parameters nor improves it, with the exception of a slight improvement in HbA1c in Type 2 DM, FDRs, and healthy controls."

      "SUMMARY": "The proliferation in the rate of diagnosis of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus continues unabated, with current recommendations for primary lifestyle changes (i.e. modification to dietary patterns) having a limited impact in reducing the incidence of these metabolic diseases. Part of the reason for the failure to alter nutritional practices is that current dietary recommendations may be unrealistic for the majority of adults. Indeed, round-the-clock access to energy-dense, nutrient-poor food makes long-term changes to dietary habits challenging. Hence, there is urgent need for innovations in the delivery of evidence-based diet interventions to rescue some of the deleterious effects on circadian biology induced by our modern-day lifestyle. With the growing appreciation that the duration over which food is consumed during a day has profound effects on numerous physiological and metabolic processes, we discuss dietary protocols that modify the timing of food intake to deliberately alter the feeding-fasting cycle. Such chrono-nutrition functions to optimise metabolism by timing nutrient intake to the acrophases of metabolic rhythms to improve whole-body insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control, and thereby positively impact metabolic health.

      "RESULTS": "The mean 72-h glucose concentration was significantly lower during the fasting period for all groups (p ≤ 0.041), with the highest glucose concentrations in the medicine-treated T2D-only group and the lowest concentrations in the sleeve gastrectomy in non-T2D group. The mean glucose profiles of all the groups showed a marked increase in interstitial glucose on breaking the fast, which was exaggerated in the two diabetes groups. The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions did not differ significantly within each group between fasting and non-fasting. No significant difference was noted in the fraction of time in the hypoglycemic range between the fasting and non-fasting periods in any group.",

      "BACKGROUND": "Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is observed by Muslims worldwide as it accounts for one of the five pillars of the religion Islam. We speculate the fasts observed during the month of Ramadan to be unintentional intermittent fasts, which may have health benefits.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "The study was attempted to know the alterations in biomarkers viz. body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), serum glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) due to Ramadan IF on type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients of western India.",
      "METHODS": "A total 50 patients of T2D were selected for above-mentioned biomarkers assessment immediately before the starting of fast followed by after 45 days.",
      "RESULTS": "The present results indicated the beneficial impact on intermittent fasting among patients (baseline versus followed up) by detecting the alterations of above-mentioned biomarkers. In overall results (n=50), the BW (Kg) and BMI (Kg/m2) values were significantly (P<0.001) decreased in followed-up patients (76.06 ± 15.41 and 27.45 ± 5.06) when compared to baseline value (77.26 ± 15.53 and 27.90 ± 5.11) while the level of HbA1c (mmol/mol) was also significantly (P<0.05) decreased in followed-up patients (7.62 ± 0.99) when compared to baseline value (7.90 ± 1.24). But no significant changes in the values of SBP and DBP were observed.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "In conclusion, this observational study revealed the reduction of body weight, BMI and serum HbA1c levels probably due to IF for the T2D patients during the holy month of Ramadan. Moreover, the IF can be utilized as a therapy along with other pharmacological therapies. It is suggested future research work with other important biomarkers, which can be easier for T2D therapy."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Various intermittent fasting (IF) dietary plans have gained popularity among obese individuals in recent years as a means of achieving weight loss. However, studies evaluating the effect of IF regimens in people with metabolic syndrome, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited. The aim of the present review was to briefly elucidate the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying the positive effects of IF, especially the effect of the proposed 'metabolic switch' on metabolism. Next, we examined the efficacy and safety of IF regimens in individuals with metabolic syndrome, prediabetes and T2D. To achieve this, we performed a MEDLINE PubMed search using combinations of various IF terms, including trials in which participants met the additional criteria for metabolic syndrome, prediabetes or T2D. We found four studies in individuals with metabolic syndrome, one study in people with prediabetes, and eight studies in people with T2D evaluating the effects of different IF regimens. The limited available evidence, with small sample sizes and short trial durations, suggests that IF regimens have a similar effectiveness compared with calorie-restriction diets for weight loss and improvement in glycaemic variables. In general, most IF regimens are effective and safe. However, there is an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with T2D who are treated with insulin or sulphonylureas. Moreover, long-term adherence to these regimens appears uncertain. There is a need for large controlled randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of IF regimens, especially in individuals with metabolic syndrome and prediabetes. If proven to be sustainable and efficacious for prolonged periods, IF could offer a promising approach to improving health at the population level, and would result in multiple public health benefits."

    "title": "Impact of Ramadan on Physical Activity and Sleeping Patterns in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes: The First Study Using Fitbit Device.",
    "abstract": {
      "INTRODUCTION": "The impact of Ramadan fasting, a type of intermittent fasting, on the management of diabetes has not been well investigated. Physical activity, sleep duration, and time of sleep are susceptible to alterations during Ramadan due to the changes in the times and numbers of meals. This study compared physical activity and sleep patterns of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during and after Ramadan using the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) and a Fitbit Flex 2 accelerometer.",
      "METHODS": "Saudi individuals (n = 36) with T2DM completed a self-reported questionnaire and wore a Fitbit device for seven consecutive days during and after Ramadan. Fitbit generated weekly step counts, activity intensities, sedentary time, and sleep durations and times. IPAQ was used to estimate the physical activity and sitting time of participants in each period. Sleep patterns were assessed in each period by a self-reported questionnaire.",
      "RESULTS": "Both Fitbit and IPAQ indicated a high prevalence of low physical activity among the participants with non-significant variances between the during and after Ramadan periods. Also, a significant short daily total sleeping hours and daily night-time sleeping hours was seen during the Ramadan period. The duration of night-time sleep was observed to be low in each period.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "This is the first study to use a Fitbit device to monitor individuals with T2DM who chose to fast during Ramadan. The study shows a high prevalence of low physical activity among Saudi individuals with T2DM in each period, and short sleep durations in the during Ramadan period compared to after Ramadan period. A high prevalence of short night-time sleep duration and excessive daytime sleeping was observed in both periods and significantly in the during Ramadan period. A larger study is needed in the future covering before, during, and after Ramadan to evaluate the impact of lifestyle changes related to Ramadan fasting on type 2 diabetes."

Nocturnal intermittent hypoxia has been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance (IR). The existing indices of hypoxia, used in polysomnography (PSG), cannot express accurately the influence of the mild desaturations precisely during sleep.

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Efficacy of insulin with different administrations for patients with diabetes complicated with perianal abscess and the effect on serum inflammatory cytokines were investigated. One hundred and sixty-seven patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent radical operation of perianal abscess in Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 2014 to December 2016 were analyzed. Before and after the operation, 89 patients who received continuous intravenous pumping of insulin for blood glucose control were set as an observation group, and 78 patients who received intermittent subcutaneous injection of insulin as a control group. The operative efficacy, wound healing time and 1-week postoperative growth of the granulation tissue were scored and compared. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 2 h postprandial blood glucose (2hPBG) before and after treatment were recorded and compared. Fasting venous blood was extracted before and on the 3rd and 7th days after operation to detect and compare serum inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Patients in the observation group had significantly higher total effective rate of the operation than that in the control group (P<0.05), and significantly shorter wound healing time and significantly lower growth score of the granulation tissue (P<0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups in FBG and 2hPBG (P>0.05). After treatment, FBG and 2hPBG were significantly lower than those before treatment (P<0.050), and FBG and 2hPBG after treatment in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). In conclusion, insulin pumps for injection during the perioperative period of patients with diabetes complicated with perianal abscess can better control the patients' blood glucose, improve the operative efficacy and promote the patients' postoperative healing. Moreover, continuous intravenous pumping of insulin is significantly better than traditional intermittent subcutaneous injection of it in controlling inflammation, so it is worthy of application."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Rapamycin (Sirolimus) slows aging, extends life span, and prevents age-related diseases, including diabetic complications such as retinopathy. Puzzlingly, rapamycin can induce insulin sensitivity, but may also induce insulin resistance or glucose intolerance without insulin resistance. This mirrors the effect of fasting and very low calorie diets, which improve insulin sensitivity and reverse type 2 diabetes, but also can cause a form of glucose intolerance known as benevolent pseudo-diabetes. There is no indication that starvation (benevolent) pseudo-diabetes is detrimental. By contrast, it is associated with better health and life extension. In transplant patients, a weak association between rapamycin/everolimus use and hyperglycemia is mostly due to a drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. When it occurs in cancer patients, the hyperglycemia is mild and reversible. No hyperglycemic effects of rapamycin/everolimus have been detected in healthy people. For antiaging purposes, rapamycin/everolimus can be administrated intermittently (e.g., once a week) in combination with intermittent carbohydrate restriction, physical exercise, and metformin."

      "OBJECTIVE": "Ectopic fat accumulation in the pancreas in response to obesity and its implication on the onset of type 2 diabetes remain poorly understood. Intermittent fasting (IF) is known to improve glucose homeostasis and insulinresistance. However, the effects of IF on fat in the pancreas and β-cell function remain largely unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of IF on pancreatic fat accumulation and its effects on islet function.",
      "METHODS": "New Zealand Obese (NZO) mice were fed a high-fat diet ad libitum (NZO-AL) or fasted every other day (intermittent fasting, NZO-IF) and pancreatic fat accumulation, glucose homoeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and islet function were determined and compared to ad libitum-fed B6.V-Lep",
      "RESULTS": "NZO-IF mice displayed better glucose homeostasis and lower fat accumulation in both the pancreas (-32%) and the liver (-35%) than NZO-AL mice. Ob/ob animals were insulin-resistant and had low fat in the pancreas but high fat in the liver. NZO-AL mice showed increased fat accumulation in both organs and exhibited an impaired islet function. Co-culture experiments demonstrated that pancreatic adipocytes induced a hypersecretion of insulin and released higher levels of free fatty acids than adipocytes of inguinal white adipose tissue.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "These results suggest that pancreatic fat participates in diabetes development, but can be prevented byIF."

      "BACKGROUND AND AIM": "The aim of the present review is to examine evidence from published studies on the effectiveness of six or more months of low carbohydrate, macrobiotic, vegan, vegetarian, Mediterranean and intermittent fasting (IF) diets compared to low fat diets on diabetes control and management.",
      "METHODS AND RESULTS": "In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed and Scopus databases were systematically searched for relevant studies. Twenty randomised controlled trials (RCTs) > 6 months that investigated the effectiveness of various dietary patterns on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, weight and lipids for the majority of low carbohydrate diets (LCDs) compared to low fat diets (LFDs). Four out of fifteen LCD interventions showed better glycemic control while weight loss was greater in one study. The Mediterranean dietary pattern demonstrated greater reduction in body weight and HbA1c levels and delayed requirement for diabetes medications. The vegan and macrobiotic diet demonstrated improved glycemic control, while the vegetarian diet showed greater body weight reduction and insulin sensitivity.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Although more long-term intervention trials are required, mounting evidence supports the view that vegan, vegetarian and Mediterranean dietary patterns should be implemented in public health strategies, in order to better control glycemic markers in individuals with T2DM."

The primary outcome was change in HbA1c and the secondary outcome was weight loss.",
      "RESULTS": "Intention-to-treat analysis showed an increase in mean [SEM] HbA1c level at 24 months in both the continuous and intermittent groups (0.4% [0.3%] vs 0.1% [0.2%] respectively; P = 0.32) (4.4 [3.3 mmol/mol] vs 1.1 [2.2 mmol/mol]; P = 0.32), with a between-group difference of 0.3% (90% CI, -0.31 to 0.83%) (3.3 mmol/mol [90% CI, -3.2 to 9.1 mmol/mol]) outside the prespecified boundary of ± 0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol), so statistical equivalence was not shown. Weight loss was maintained (P < 0.001) at -3.9 kg [1.1 kg] in both groups at 24 months, with a between-group difference of 0.07 kg (90% CI, -2.5 to 2.6 kg) outside the prespecified boundary of ±2.5 kg.

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an effective dietary intervention to counteract obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities. Previously, we and others have highlighted white adipose tissue (WAT) browning as the main underlying mechanism of IF-mediated metabolic benefits. However, whether IF retains its efficacy in different models, such as genetically obese/diabetic animals, is unknown. Here, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were subjected to 16 weeks of isocaloric IF, and comprehensive metabolic phenotyping was conducted to assess the metabolic effects of IF. Unlike our previous study, isocaloric IF-subjected ob/ob animals failed to exhibit reduced body weight gain, lower fat mass, or decreased liver lipid accumulation. Moreover, isocaloric IF did not result in increased thermogenesis nor induce WAT browning in ob/ob mice. These findings indicate that isocaloric IF may not be an effective approach for regulating body weight in ob/ob animals, posing the possible limitations of IF to treat obesity. However, despite the lack of improvement in insulin sensitivity, isocaloric IF-subjected ob/ob animals displayed improved glucose tolerance as well as higher postprandial insulin level, with elevated incretin expression, suggesting that isocaloric IF is effective in improving nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. Together, this study uncovers the insulinotropic effect of isocaloric IF, independent of adipose thermogenesis, which is potentially complementary for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obesity is a condition associated with an increased risk of metabolic disorders, and in particular of type-2 diabetes (T2D). The treatment and prevention of obesity and associated metabolic disorders present great medical challenges. A major therapeutic goal in T2D is to control blood glucose levels, which can be achieved by pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures. The latter include increased physical activity and reduction of body fat mass by limiting dietary caloric content. Low-calorie diets (LCDs) involve a reduction in daily caloric intake by 25% to 30%. LCDs should be individualized depending on the patient's energy requirements, the severity of the obesity, and any accompanying diseases and treatments. Intermittent fasting (IF) involves caloric restriction for one or several days a week, or every day as the prolongation of the overnight fast. The results of recent clinical trials have shown that LCDs and intermittent fasting in patients with obesity (including those with coexisting T2D) can lead to a reduction in body fat mass and metabolic parameter improvements. These beneficial effects arise not only from the loss of body mass, but also from the activation of metabolic pathways specific to fasting conditions. However, the paucity of large-scale randomized controlled trials makes it difficult to prescribe LCDs or IF as reliable, routine methods for successful and stable weight loss."

      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES": "The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, with equivalence prespecified by a 90% CI margin of ±0.5%. The secondary outcome was weight loss with equivalence set at ±2.5 kg (±1.75 kg for fat mass loss and ±0.75 kg for fat-free mass loss). All other outcomes were tested for superiority.",
      "RESULTS": "Of the 137 randomized participants (77 women and 60 men; mean [SD] age, 61.0 [9.1] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 36.0 [5.8] [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]; and mean [SD] HbA1c level, 7.3% [1.3%]), 97 completed the trial. Intention-to-treat analysis showed similar reductions in mean (SEM) HbA1c level between the continuous and intermittent energy restriction groups (-0.5% [0.2%] vs -0.3% [0.1%]; P = .65), with a between-group difference of 0.2% (90% CI, -0.2% to 0.5%) meeting the criteria for equivalence.

Baseline skin autofluorescence was elevated in participants with incident type 2 diabetes and/or CVD and in those who had died (all p < 0.001), compared with individuals who survived and remained free of the two diseases. Skin autofluorescence predicted the development of type 2 diabetes, CVD and mortality, independent of several traditional risk factors, such as the metabolic syndrome, glucose and HbA",

      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent energy restriction (IER) involves short periods of severe energy restriction interspersed with periods of adequate energy intake, and can induce weight loss. Insulin sensitivity is impaired by short-term, complete energy restriction, but the effects of IER are not well known. In randomised order, fourteen lean men (age: 25 (sd 4) years; BMI: 24 (sd 2) kg/m2; body fat: 17 (4) %) consumed 24-h diets providing 100 % (10 441 (sd 812) kJ; energy balance (EB)) or 25 % (2622 (sd 204) kJ; energy restriction (ER)) of estimated energy requirements, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g of glucose drink) after fasting overnight. Plasma/serum glucose, insulin, NEFA, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) were assessed before and after (0 h) each 24-h dietary intervention, and throughout the 2-h OGTT. Homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) assessed the fasted response and incremental AUC (iAUC) or total AUC (tAUC) were calculated during the OGTT. At 0 h, HOMA2-IR was 23 % lower after ER compared with EB (P<0·05). During the OGTT, serum glucose iAUC (P<0·001), serum insulin iAUC (P<0·05) and plasma NEFA tAUC (P<0·01) were greater during ER, but GLP-1 (P=0·161), GIP (P=0·473) and FGF21 (P=0·497) tAUC were similar between trials. These results demonstrate that severe energy restriction acutely impairs postprandial glycaemic control in lean men, despite reducing HOMA2-IR. Chronic intervention studies are required to elucidate the long-term effects of IER on indices of insulin sensitivity, particularly in the absence of weight loss."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "A series of large-scale randomised controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of lifestyle change in preventing type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance. Participants in these trials consumed a low-fat diet, lost a moderate amount of weight and/or increased their physical activity. Weight loss appears to be the primary driver of type 2 diabetes risk reduction, with individual dietary components playing a minor role. The effect of weight loss via other dietary approaches, such as low-carbohydrate diets, a Mediterranean dietary pattern, intermittent fasting or very-low-energy diets, on the incidence of type 2 diabetes has not been tested. These diets-as described here-could be equally, if not more effective in preventing type 2 diabetes than the tested low-fat diet, and if so, would increase choice for patients. There is also a need to understand the effect of foods and diets on beta-cell function, as the available evidence suggests moderate weight loss, as achieved in the diabetes prevention trials, improves insulin sensitivity but not beta-cell function. Finally, prediabetes is an umbrella term for different prediabetic states, each with distinct underlying pathophysiology. The limited data available question whether moderate weight loss is effective at preventing type 2 diabetes in each of the prediabetes subtypes."

      "DESIGN": "Nine prediabetic [hemoglobin A1c; 6.1% (0.2%)] patients were recruited to take part in a resting control, a continuous exercise (90% of lactate threshold), and a high-intensity exercise trial (6 30-second sprints). Muscle biopsies were drawn before and after each 60-minute trial. A labeled ([6,62H2]glucose) intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed immediately after the second muscle sample.",
      "RESULTS": "Fasting muscle IP6K1 content did not correlate with insulin sensitivity (SI2*) (P = 0.961). High-intensity exercise reduced IP6K1 muscle protein and messenger RNA expression (P = 0.001). There was no effect on protein IP6K1 content after continuous exercise. Akt308 phosphorylation of was significantly greater after high-intensity exercise. Intermittent exercise reduced hepatic glucose production after the same trial. The same intervention also increased SI2*, and this effect was significantly greater compared with the effect of continuous exercise improvements. Our in vitro experiment demonstrated that the chemical inhibition of IP6K1 increased insulin signaling in C2C12 myotubes.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "The in vivo and in vitro approaches used in the current study suggest that a decrease in muscle IP6K1 may be linked to whole body increases in SI2*. In addition, high-intensity exercise reduces hepatic glucose production in insulin-resistant individuals."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is associated with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although several studies have revealed that intermittent hypoxia (IH) in OSAHS may further aggravate pancreatic β cell damage and promote the evolution of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) by increasing oxidative stress, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Honokiol, a potent radical scavenger, has been demonstrated to ameliorate oxidative stress in many cases. The present study aimed to explore the potential mechanism of IH and diabetes synergistically damage and destruct the pancreatic β cell, examine the effects of honokiol on ameliorating pancreatic β cell injury in this context and explore the mechanism of such effects. High glucose (HG) cultured INS-1 cells were exposed to 50 μM of honokiol for 24, 48 and 72 h with or without IH intervention. T2DM rats were treated with honokiol and exposed to 80 s of IH followed by 160 s of normoxia for 8 weeks. The cell proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative stress were measured. Blood glucose, insulin, glucagon and HOMA-IR (Homeostasis model assessment -insulin resistence) were also detected, and the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were detected by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. Honokiol can reduce oxidative stress, cytotoxicity and apoptosis in the INS-1 cells of rats receiving HG treatment or both HG and IH treatment. IH can further aggravate pancreas dysfunction, cause a marked elevation in fasting blood glucose, glucagon, HOMA-IR and oxidative stress levels in DM rats. In addition, honokiol can effectively activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway and reverse this pancreatic dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. These findings indicate that honokiol acts as a potent ROS scavenger via Nrf2/ARE pathway and effectively attenuates oxidative stress and improves pancreatic β cell function of DM rats under IH treatment."

      "SUMMARY": "Decreasing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is the primary goal of current diabetes management due to intervention studies in type 1 and type 2 diabetes associating levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) with lower complication risk. Strategic self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is also recommended to achieve greater time in range, with fewer extremes of hypo- or hyperglycemia. Unlike A1C, SMBG can distinguish among fasting, prandial, and postprandial hyperglycemia; uncover glycemic variability, including potentially dangerous hypoglycemia; and provide feedback to patients about the effects of behavior and medication on glycemic control. However, it has the drawback of capturing only static glucose readings and users are often dependent on time-pressed clinicians to interpret numerous data points. A novel flash continuous glucose monitoring (FCGM) device used for a single 2-week period with a readily interpretable data report know as the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) has the potential to overcome limitations of conventional technologies, with less cost and greater convenience. This review summarizes the rationale for using intermittent FCGM as a supplement to A1C in primary care, and provides a stepwise approach to interpreting the AGP visual display for efficient individualized therapy."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obesity-induced diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and progressive beta cell failure. In islets of mice with obesity-induced diabetes, we observe increased beta cell death and impaired autophagic flux. We hypothesized that intermittent fasting, a clinically sustainable therapeutic strategy, stimulates autophagic flux to ameliorate obesity-induced diabetes. Our data show that despite continued high-fat intake, intermittent fasting restores autophagic flux in islets and improves glucose tolerance by enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, beta cell survival, and nuclear expression of NEUROG3, a marker of pancreatic regeneration. In contrast, intermittent fasting does not rescue beta-cell death or induce NEUROG3 expression in obese mice with lysosomal dysfunction secondary to deficiency of the lysosomal membrane protein, LAMP2 or haplo-insufficiency of BECN1/Beclin 1, a protein critical for autophagosome formation. Moreover, intermittent fasting is sufficient to provoke beta cell death in nonobese lamp2 null mice, attesting to a critical role for lysosome function in beta cell homeostasis under fasting conditions. Beta cells in intermittently-fasted LAMP2- or BECN1-deficient mice exhibit markers of autophagic failure with accumulation of damaged mitochondria and upregulation of oxidative stress. Thus, intermittent fasting preserves organelle quality via the autophagy-lysosome pathway to enhance beta cell survival and stimulates markers of regeneration in obesity-induced diabetes."

      "BACKGROUND": "Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended as a key component of the management plan for diabetes therapy during pregnancy. No existing systematic reviews consider the benefits/effectiveness of various techniques of blood glucose monitoring on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. The effectiveness of the various monitoring techniques is unclear.",
      "OBJECTIVES": "To compare techniques of blood glucose monitoring and their impact on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.",
      "SEARCH METHODS": "We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2016), searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted trial authors.",
      "SELECTION CRITERIA": "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing techniques of blood glucose monitoring including SMBG, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or clinic monitoring among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2). Trials investigating timing and frequency of monitoring were also included. RCTs using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.",
      "DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS": "Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.",
      "MAIN RESULTS": "This review update includes at total of 10 trials (538) women (468 women with type 1 diabetes and 70 women with type 2 diabetes). The trials took place in Europe and the USA. Five of the 10 included studies were at moderate risk of bias, four studies were at low to moderate risk of bias, and one study was at high risk of bias. The trials are too small to show differences in important outcomes such as macrosomia, preterm birth, miscarriage or death of baby. Almost all the reported GRADE outcomes were assessed as being very low-quality evidence. This was due to design limitations in the studies, wide confidence intervals, small sample sizes, and few events. In addition, there was high heterogeneity for some outcomes.Various methods of glucose monitoring were compared in the trials. Neither pooled analyses nor individual trial analyses showed any clear advantages of one monitoring technique over another for primary and secondary outcomes. Many important outcomes were not reported.1. Self-monitoring versus standard care (two studies, 43 women): there was no clear difference for caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.49; one study, 28 women) or glycaemic control (both very low-quality), and not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality and morbidity composite. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, neurosensory disability, and preterm birth were not reported in either study.2. Self-monitoring versus hospitalisation (one study, 100 women): there was no clear difference for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and hypertension) (RR 4.26, 95% CI 0.52 to 35.16; very low-quality: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.22; very low-quality). There was no clear difference in caesarean section or preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (both very low quality), and the sample size was too small to assess perinatal mortality (very low-quality). Large-for-gestational age, mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability and preterm birth less than 34 weeks were not reported.3. Pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring (one study, 61 women): there was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.28; very low-quality), large-for-gestational age (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.85; very low-quality) or glycaemic control (very low-quality). The results for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: pre-eclampsia and perinatal mortality are not meaningful because these outcomes were too rare to show differences in a small sample (all very low-quality). The study did not report the outcomes mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability or preterm birth.4. Automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system (three studies, 84 women): there was no clear difference for caesarean section (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48; one study, 32 women; very low-quality), and mortality or morbidity composite in the one study that reported these outcomes. There were no clear differences for glycaemic control (very low-quality). No studies reported hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal mortality), neurosensory disability or preterm birth.5.CGM versus intermittent monitoring (two studies, 225 women): there was no clear difference for pre-eclampsia (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.59; low-quality), caesarean section (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54; I² = 62%; very low-quality) and large-for-gestational age (average RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.92; I² = 82%; very low-quality). Glycaemic control indicated by mean maternal HbA1c was lower for women in the continuous monitoring group (mean difference (MD) -0.60 %, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.29; one study, 71 women; moderate-quality). There was not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality and there were no clear differences for preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (low-quality). Mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability and preterm birth less than 34 weeks were not reported.6. Constant CGM versus intermittent CGM (one study, 25 women): there was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.79; very low-quality), glycaemic control (mean blood glucose in the 3rd trimester) (MD -0.14 mmol/L, 95% CI -2.00 to 1.72; very low-quality) or preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.08 to 15.46; very low-quality). Other primary (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal mortality), mortality or morbidity composite, and neurosensory disability) or GRADE outcomes (preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation) were not reported.",
      "AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS": "This review found no evidence that any glucose monitoring technique is superior to any other technique among pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The evidence base for the effectiveness of monitoring techniques is weak and additional evidence from large well-designed randomised trials is required to inform choices of glucose monitoring techniques."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Current sociodemographic predictions point to a demographic shift in developed and developing countries that will result in an unprecedented increase of the elderly population. This will be accompanied by an increase in age-related conditions that will strongly impair human health and quality of life. For this reason, aging is a major concern worldwide. Healthy aging depends on a combination of individual genetic factors and external environmental factors. Diet has been proved to be a powerful tool to modulate aging and caloric restriction has emerged as a valuable intervention in this regard. However, many questions about how a controlled caloric restriction intervention affects aging-related processes are still unanswered. Nutrient sensing pathways become deregulated with age and lose effectiveness with age. These pathways are a link between diet and aging. Thus, fully understanding this link is a mandatory step before bringing caloric restriction into practice. MicroRNAs have emerged as important regulators of cellular functions and can be modified by diet. Some microRNAs target genes encoding proteins and enzymes belonging to the nutrient sensing pathways and, therefore, may play key roles in the modulation of the aging process. In this review, we aimed to show the relationship between diet, nutrient sensing pathways and microRNAs in the context of aging."

      "SUMMARY": "There is increasing experimental evidence for beneficial effects of calorie restriction and intermittent fasting in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In humans, prolonged fasting is established as a health-promoting complementary treatment in Europe and claimed to improve metabolism by a complex hormetic response. We aimed to investigate effects of a one-week fasting period compared to usual care in T2DM by means of a pilot trial. Patients with manifest T2DM medically treated with oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin were randomly assigned to a 7-day fasting program followed by dietary advice or to usual care and dietary advice only. Fasting was performed according to the method of Buchinger with a nutritional energy intake of 300kcal/day by liquids only and stepwise re-introduction of solid food thereafter. Outcomes were assessed baseline and after 4 months. Of 46 enrolled participants, 32 (n=16 each group) completed the trial and were included for final analyses. Fasting was well accepted, there were no serious adverse events. After 4 months mean weight decreased by 3.5 kg and 2.0 kg in the fasting vs. control group (p=0.03) paralleled by greater reduction of abdominal circumference (p=0.001). Fasting led to a significant decrease of systolic/diastolic blood pressure (p=0.01; p=0.003) and increased quality-of-life (p=0.04), while for HbA"

These benefits may be offset by the previously reported dysregulation in the circadian rhythm, excess glucocorticoid levels and action, and insulin resistance, explaining increased prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes mellitus."

    "title": "Is There an Optimal Diet for Weight Management and Metabolic Health?",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Individuals can lose body weight and improve health status on a wide range of energy (calorie)-restricted dietary interventions. In this paper, we have reviewed the effectiveness of the most commonly utilized diets, including low-fat, low-carbohydrate, and Mediterranean approaches, in addition to commercial slimming programs, meal replacements, and newly popularized intermittent fasting diets. We also consider the role of artificial sweeteners in weight management. Low-fat diets tend to improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol the most, while lower-carbohydrate diets may preferentially improve triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, differences between diets are marginal. Weight loss improves almost all obesity-related co-morbidities and metabolic markers, regardless of the macronutrient composition of the diet, but individuals do vary in preferences and ability to adhere to different diets. Optimizing adherence is the most important factor for weight loss success, and this is enhanced by regular professional contact and supportive behavioral change programs. Maintaining weight losses in the long term remains the biggest challenge, and is undermined by an \"obesogenic\" environment and biological adaptations that accompany weight loss."

      "SUMMARY": "Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with type 2 diabetes. We have previously developed a mouse model of intermittent hypoxia (IH) mimicking oxyhemoglobin desaturations in patients with sleep apnea and have shown that IH increases fasting glucose, hepatic glucose output, and plasma catecholamines. We hypothesize that adrenal medulla modulates glucose responses to IH and that such responses can be prevented by adrenal medullectomy. We performed adrenal medullectomy or sham surgery in lean C57BL/6J mice, which were exposed to IH or intermittent air (control) for 4 wk followed by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) in unanesthetized unrestrained animals. IH was administered during the 12-h light phase (9 AM to 9 PM) by decreasing inspired oxygen from 21 to 6.5% 60 cycles/h. Insulin sensitivity (S"

      "METHODS": "A search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and Cochrane library for original research articles investigating the use of very low calorie diets (VLCD) in people with T2DM. The search terms used included \"VLCD\" or \"very low energy diet\" or \"very low energy restriction\" or \"IER\" or \"intermittent fasting\" or \"calorie restriction\" or \"diabetes mellitus type 2\" and \"type 2 diabetes\". Reference lists of selected articles were also screened for relevant publications. Only research articles written in English, which also included an explanation of medication changes were included. A recent pilot trial using the 5:2 IER method, conducted by our research group, will also be summarized.",
      "RESULTS": "A total of 8 studies were found that investigated the use of VLCD in T2DM and discussed medication management. Overall these studies indicate that the use of a VLCD for people with T2DM usually require the cessation of medication to prevent hypoglycemia. Therefore, the 5:2 IER method will also require medication changes, but as seen in our pilot trial, may not require total cessation of medication, rather a cessation on the 2 IER days only.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Guidelines outlined here can be used in the initial stages of a 2-d IER diet, but extensive blood glucose monitoring is still required to make the necessary individual reductions to medications in response to weight loss."

    "title": "The Effectiveness of Different Diet Strategies to Reduce Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Youth.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents has become a prominent clinical issue in recent decades. Increasing numbers of young people have risk factors for type 2 diabetes, particularly obesity, indicating the need for effective type 2 diabetes prevention strategies. The aim of this review was to identify specific dietary strategies that optimize improvements in risk factors for type 2 diabetes in youth and hence reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes development. Our review of the current literature indicates that dietary interventions lead to weight loss when intervention adherence is high. However, in addition to weight loss, a diet that is reduced in carbohydrates may optimize improvements in other type 2 diabetes risk factors, including insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. While further research is needed to confirm this finding, reduced carbohydrate diets may include a very low-carbohydrate diet, a very low-energy diet, a lower-glycemic-index diet, and/or an intermittent fasting diet. This array of dietary strategies provides a suite of intervention options for clinicians to recommend to young people at risk of type 2 diabetes. However, these findings are in contrast to current guidelines for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in adults which recommends a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet."

    "abstract": {
      "PURPOSE": "We tested the hypothesis that low-volume high-intensity swimming has a larger impact on insulin sensitivity and glucose control than high-volume low-intensity swimming in inactive premenopausal women with mild hypertension.",
      "METHODS": "Sixty-two untrained premenopausal women were randomised to an inactive control (n = 20; CON), a high-intensity low-volume (n = 21; HIT) or a low-intensity high-volume (n = 21; LIT) training group. During the 15-week intervention period, HIT performed 3 weekly 6-10 × 30-s all-out swimming intervals (average heart rate (HR) = 86 ± 3 % HRmax) interspersed by 2-min recovery periods and LIT swam continuously for 1 h at low intensity (average HR = 73 ± 3 % HRmax). Fasting blood samples were taken and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted pre- and post-intervention.",
      "RESULTS": "After HIT, resting plasma [insulin] was lowered (17 ± 34 %; P < 0.05) but remained similar after LIT and CON. Following HIT, 60-min OGTT plasma [insulin] and [glucose] was lowered (24 ± 30 % and 10 ± 16 %; P < 0.05) but remained similar after LIT and CON. Total area under the curve for plasma [glucose] was lower (P < 0.05) after HIT than LIT (660 ± 141 vs. 860 ± 325 mmol min L(-1)). Insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) had increased (P < 0.05) by 22 ± 34 % after HIT, with no significant change after LIT or CON, respectively. Plasma soluble intracellular cell adhesion molecule 1 was lowered (P < 0.05) by 4 ± 8 and 3 ± 9 % after HIT and CON, respectively, while plasma soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 had decreased (P < 0.05) by 8 ± 23 % after HIT only.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "These findings suggest that low-volume high-intensity intermittent swimming is an effective and time-efficient training strategy for improving insulin sensitivity, glucose control and biomarkers of vascular function in inactive, middle-aged mildly hypertensive women."

      "INTRODUCTION": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia is considered as a preconditioning status in cardiovascular health to inducing resistance to the low oxygen supply. Diabetic cardiomyopathy leads to inability of the heart to effective circulation of blood preventing of consequent tissue damages so; the aim of this study was elucidation of effect of chronic exposure to hypoxia on Cardiac fibrosis and expression of GLUT4 in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy.",
      "METHODS": "A total number of 30 rats were randomly divided into three groups; 1: Normoxia control group (NN, n = 10). 2: Normoxia diabetic group (ND, n = 10) that took fat diet for 2 weeks then were injected by streptozotocin (37 mg/kg) and 3: Hypoxia diabetic group (HD, n = 10): that were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) (altitude ≈3400 m, 14% oxygen for 8 weeks). After hypoxia challenge, plasma metabolic parameters including: fasting blood glucose (FBS), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) were measured by colorimetric assay. Cardiac expression of GLUT4 protein and cardiac collagen accumulation were determined in the excised left ventricle by western blotting, and Masson trichrome staining respectively.",
      "RESULTS": "Based on resultant data, FBS, TG and TC were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in HD vs. ND. Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) were also significantly attenuated after exposed to CIH in HD group compared to ND group (P < 0.05). Significant increase in packed cell volume and hemoglobin concentration was observed in HD group compared to ND group (P < 0.05). Comparison of heart wet weight between three groups showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) with lower amount in HD and ND versus NN. Myocardial fibrosis was significantly more pronounced in ND when compared to NN. Eight weeks exposure to hypoxia ameliorated this increase in HD group. Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased GLUT4 protein expression in HD compared to ND group (P < 0.05).",
      "CONCLUSION": "Data suggested that CIH might potentiate to improve glucose homeostasis and cardiac tissue structural damages created in type 2 diabetes (T2D)."

      "SUMMARY": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes. Causal mechanisms mediating this association are not well defined; however, augmented lipolysis in adipose might be involved. Here, we investigated the effect of acipimox treatment (lipolysis inhibitor) on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia (IH). C57BL6/J mice were exposed for 14 days to IH or control conditions. IH was created by decreasing the fraction of inspired oxygen from 20.9 to 6.5%, 60 times/h. Control exposure was air (fraction of inspired oxygen, 20.9%) delivered at an identical flow rate. Acipimox was provided in drinking water (0.5 g/ml) during exposures. After exposures, intraperitoneal insulin (0.5 IU/kg) and glucose (1 g/kg) tolerance tests were performed, and primary adipocytes were isolated for lipolysis experiments. IH elevated fasting glucose by 51% and worsened glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity by 33 and 102%, respectively. In parallel, IH increased spontaneous lipolysis by 264%, and reduced epididymal fat mass by 15% and adipocyte size by 8%. Acipimox treatment prevented IH-induced lipolysis and increased epididymal fat mass and adipocyte size by 19 and 10%, respectively. Acipimox fully prevented IH-induced impairments in fasting glycemia, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity. For all reported results, P less than 0.05 was considered significant. Augmented lipolysis contributes to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance observed in mice exposed to IH. Acipimox treatment ameliorated the metabolic consequences of IH and might represent a novel treatment option for patients with obstructive sleep apnea."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "The intermittent energy restriction (IER) approach to weight loss involves short periods of substantial (75-100 %) energy restriction (ER) interspersed with normal eating. This study aimed to characterise the early metabolic response to these varying degrees of ER, which occurs acutely and prior to weight loss. Ten (three female) healthy, overweight/obese participants (36 (SEM 5) years; 29·0 (sem 1·1) kg/m2) took part in this acute three-way cross-over study. Participants completed three 1-d dietary interventions in a randomised order with a 1-week washout period: isoenergetic intake, partial 75 % ER and total 100 % ER. Fasting and postprandial (6-h) metabolic responses to a liquid test meal were assessed the following morning via serial blood sampling and indirect calorimetry. Food intake was also recorded for two subsequent days of ad libitum intake. Relative to the isoenergetic control, postprandial glucose responses were increased following total ER (+142 %; P=0·015) and to a lesser extent after partial ER (+76 %; P=0·051). There was also a delay in the glucose time to peak after total ER only (P=0·024). Both total and partial ER interventions produced comparable reductions in postprandial TAG responses (-75 and -59 %, respectively; both P<0·05) and 3-d energy intake deficits of approximately 30 % (both P=0·015). Resting and meal-induced thermogenesis were not significantly affected by either ER intervention. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the ability of substantial ER to acutely alter postprandial glucose-lipid metabolism (with partial ER producing the more favourable overall response), as well as incomplete energy-intake compensation amongst overweight/obese participants. Further investigations are required to establish how metabolism adapts over time to the repeated perturbations experienced during IER, as well as the implications for long-term health."

Continuous outcome variables are reported using mixed models.",
      "RESULTS": "At 24 months, the mean percentage of excess weight loss was 22% (95% CI, 15 to 28, p < 0.0001) or 7.0% total body weight loss (95% CI, 5.0 to 9.0, p < 0.0001).

Fasting plasma glucose declined by 15 mg/dL (95% CI, 0 to 29, p = 0.0564) on average from 151 mg/dL at baseline. Among subjects who were hypertensive at baseline, systolic blood pressure declined 10 mmHg (95% CI, 2 to 19, p = 0.02), diastolic blood pressure declined by 6 mmHg (95% CI, 0 to 12, p = 0.0423), and mean arterial pressure declined 7 mmHg (95% CI, 2 to 13, p = 0.014). Waist circumference was significantly reduced by 7 cm (95% CI, 4 to 10, p < 0.0001) from a baseline of 120 cm.

      "SUMMARY": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the association between obstructive sleep apnea severity and glucose control differs between patients with newly diagnosed and untreated type 2 diabetes, and patients with known and treated type 2 diabetes. This multicentre cross-sectional study included 762 patients investigated by sleep recording for suspected obstructive sleep apnea, 497 of whom were previously diagnosed and treated for type 2 diabetes (treated diabetic patients), while 265 had no medical history of diabetes but had fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg dL(-1) and/or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c ) ≥6.5% consistent with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (untreated diabetic patients). Multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent association between HbA1c and obstructive sleep apnea severity in treated and untreated patients with diabetes. In untreated diabetic patients, HbA1c was positively associated with apnea-hypopnea index (P = 0.0007) and 3% oxygen desaturation index (P = 0.0016) after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, alcohol habits, metabolic dyslipidaemia, hypertension, statin use and study site. The adjusted mean value of HbA1c increased from 6.68% in the lowest quartile of the apnea-hypopnea index (<17) to 7.20% in the highest quartile of the apnea-hypopnea index (>61; P = 0.033 for linear trend). In treated patients with diabetes, HbA1c was associated with non-sleep variables, including age, metabolic dyslipidaemia and insulin use, but not with obstructive sleep apnea severity. Obstructive sleep apnea may adversely affect glucose control in patients with newly diagnosed and untreated type 2 diabetes, but may have a limited impact in patients with overt type 2 diabetes receiving anti-diabetic medications."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the plasma soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) play a major role in developing macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes, including peripheral arterial occlusion disease (PAOD). Cilostazol is an antiplatelet, antithrombotic agent, which has been used for the treatment of PAOD. We hypothesized that cilostazol attenuates the severity of PAOD in patients with type 2 diabetes through the augmentation of plasma sRAGE. Ninety type 2 diabetic patients with PAOD defined as intermittent claudication with ankle-brachial index (ABI) ≦0.9 were recruited for an open-labeled, placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks with oral cilostazol 100 mg twice daily (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45). Fasting plasma sRAGE, endothelial variables of E-selectin, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and inflammatory markers of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined. After completely the 52-week treatment program, the ABI values were elevated in cilostazol group (P < 0.001). The plasma sRAGE was significantly increased (P = 0.007), and hsCRP, sVCAM, and E-selectin concentrations were significantly decreased (P = 0.028, <0.001 and <0.001, respectively) with cilostazol treatment. In a partial correlation analysis with adjustments for sex and age, the net change of sRAGE significantly correlated with the change of ABI in the cilostazol group (P = 0.043). In a stepwise multiple regression model, only the change with regards to sRAGE was significantly associated with the change of ABI (P = 0.046). Our results suggest that cilostazol may effectively attenuate the severity of PAOD in patients with type 2 diabetes. Plasma sRAGE plays a role as an independent predictor for improving the index of PAOD."

      "SUMMARY": "Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting are known to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in several species including humans. The aim of this study was to unravel potential mechanisms by which these interventions improve insulin sensitivity and protect from type 2 diabetes. Diabetes-susceptible New Zealand Obese mice were either 10% calorie restricted (CR) or fasted every other day (IF), and compared to ad libitum (AL) fed control mice. AL mice showed a diabetes prevalence of 43%, whereas mice under CR and IF were completely protected against hyperglycemia. Proteomic analysis of hepatic lipid droplets revealed significantly higher levels of PSMD9 (co-activator Bridge-1), MIF (macrophage migration inhibitor factor), TCEB2 (transcription elongation factor B (SIII), polypeptide 2), ACY1 (aminoacylase 1) and FABP5 (fatty acid binding protein 5), and a marked reduction of GSTA3 (glutathione S-transferase alpha 3) in samples of CR and IF mice. In addition, accumulation of diacylglycerols (DAGs) was significantly reduced in livers of IF mice (P=0.045) while CR mice showed a similar tendency (P=0.062). In particular, 9 DAG species were significantly reduced in response to IF, of which DAG-40:4 and DAG-40:7 also showed significant effects after CR. This was associated with a decreased PKCε activation and might explain the improved insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, our data indicate that protection against diabetes upon caloric restriction and intermittent fasting associates with a modulation of lipid droplet protein composition and reduction of intracellular DAG species."

    "title": "Peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes and postprandial lipidaemia: Is there a link?",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Peripheral arterial disease, manifested as intermittent claudication or critical ischaemia, or identified by an ankle/brachial index < 0.9, is present in at least one in every four patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Several reasons exist for peripheral arterial disease in diabetes. In addition to hyperglycaemia, smoking and hypertension, the dyslipidaemia that accompanies type 2 diabetes and is characterised by increased triglyceride levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations also seems to contribute to this association. Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in postprandial lipidaemia, as a result of various prospective studies showing that non-fasting triglycerides predict the onset of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease better than fasting measurements do. Additionally, the use of certain specific postprandial particle markers, such as apolipoprotein B-48, makes it easier and more simple to approach the postprandial phenomenon. Despite this, only a few studies have evaluated the role of postprandial triglycerides in the development of peripheral arterial disease and type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this review is to examine the epidemiology and risk factors of peripheral arterial disease in type 2 diabetes, focusing on the role of postprandial triglycerides and particles."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obstructive sleep apnea causes intermittent hypoxia (IH) and is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. IH increases plasma catecholamine levels, which may increase insulin resistance and suppress insulin secretion. The objective of this study was to determine if adrenal medullectomy (MED) prevents metabolic dysfunction in IH. MED or sham surgery was performed in 60 male C57BL/6J mice, which were then exposed to IH or control conditions (intermittent air) for 6 weeks. IH increased plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, increased fasting blood glucose and lowered basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. MED decreased baseline epinephrine and prevented the IH induced increase in epinephrine, whereas the norepinephrine response remained intact. MED improved glucose tolerance in mice exposed to IH, attenuated the impairment in basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but did not prevent IH-induced fasting hyperglycemia or insulin resistance. We conclude that the epinephrine release from the adrenal medulla during IH suppresses insulin secretion causing hyperglycemia."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Intermittent hypoxemia is a fundamental pathophysiological consequence of sleep-disordered breathing and may alter glucose metabolism. To characterize the association between sleep-related intermittent hypoxemia and glucose metabolism, overnight pulse-oximetry and an oral glucose tolerance test were completed in a cohort of middle-aged and older Japanese adults.",
      "METHODS": "The study sample consisted of 1836 community-dwelling Japanese (age, 30-79 years; women, 65.5%; mean body mass index, 23.1 kg/m(2)). The oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was quantified during sleep using a ≥3% oxygen desaturation threshold and categorized as normal (<5.0 events/h), mild (5.0-15.0 events/h), and moderate to severe (≥15.0 events/h). The independent associations between the ODI and the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, and two metrics of insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and Matsuda index] were examined.",
      "RESULTS": "Compared with subjects with an ODI < 5 events/h, the adjusted odds ratio for prevalent impaired fasting glucose, glucose intolerance, and diabetes for subjects with an ODI ≥15.0 events/h were 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-2.23), 1.69 (1.03-2.76), and 1.28 (0.59-2.79), respectively. Both HOMA-IR and Matsuda index were significantly associated with the severity of sleep-related intermittent hypoxemia as assessed by the ODI (P for trend = 0.03 and 0.007, respectively).",
      "CONCLUSION": "Among middle-aged and older Japanese adults, sleep-related intermittent hypoxemia is associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obstructive sleep apnea causes chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) and is associated with impaired glucose metabolism, but mechanisms are unknown. Carotid bodies orchestrate physiological responses to hypoxemia by activating the sympathetic nervous system. Therefore, we hypothesized that carotid body denervation would abolish glucose intolerance and insulin resistance induced by chronic IH. Male C57BL/6J mice underwent carotid sinus nerve dissection (CSND) or sham surgery and then were exposed to IH or intermittent air (IA) for 4 or 6 wk. Hypoxia was administered by decreasing a fraction of inspired oxygen from 20.9% to 6.5% once per minute, during the 12-h light phase (9 a.m.-9 p.m.). As expected, denervated mice exhibited blunted hypoxic ventilatory responses. In sham-operated mice, IH increased fasting blood glucose, baseline hepatic glucose output (HGO), and expression of a rate-liming hepatic enzyme of gluconeogenesis phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), whereas the whole body glucose flux during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was not changed. IH did not affect glucose tolerance after adjustment for fasting hyperglycemia in the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. CSND prevented IH-induced fasting hyperglycemia and increases in baseline HGO and liver PEPCK expression. CSND trended to augment the insulin-stimulated glucose flux and enhanced liver Akt phosphorylation at both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. IH increased serum epinephrine levels and liver sympathetic innervation, and both increases were abolished by CSND. We conclude that chronic IH induces fasting hyperglycemia increasing baseline HGO via the CSN sympathetic output from carotid body chemoreceptors, but does not significantly impair whole body insulin sensitivity."

      "SUMMARY": "We evaluated the effects of recreational football training combined with calorie-restricted diet (football + diet) vs calorie-restricted diet alone (diet) on aerobic fitness, lipid profile, and insulin resistance indicators in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Forty-four T2D patients aged 48-68 years (27 females, 17 males) were randomly allocated to the football + diet group (FDG; n = 22) or to the diet group (DG; n = 22), of whom 19 FDG and 15 DG subjects completed the study. The football training was performed for 3 × 40 min/week for 12 weeks. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning, treadmill testing, and fasting blood samplings were performed pre and post-intervention. After 12 weeks, maximal oxygen uptake (VO₂max ) was elevated (P < 0.05) by 10 ± 4% in FDG but not in DG (-3 ± 4%, P < 0.05). After 12 weeks, reductions in blood triglycerides (0.4 ± 0.1 mmol/L), total cholesterol (0.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein, and very low-density lipoprotein levels were observed only in FDG. Fat mass decreased (P < 0.05) by 3.4 ± 0.4 kg in FDG and 3.7 ± 0.4 kg in DG. The lower (P < 0.05) glucagon and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance indicated an improvement in insulin sensitivity in FDG. In conclusion, football combined with restricted diet was effective in enhancing VO₂max , reducing total cholesterol and triglycerides, and increasing insulin sensitivity, potentially providing better tools for the prevention of T2D complications than diet alone."

      "BACKGROUND": "Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recommended as a key component of the management plan for diabetes therapy during pregnancy. No existing systematic reviews consider the benefits/effectiveness of various techniques of blood glucose monitoring on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. The effectiveness of the various monitoring techniques is unclear.",
      "OBJECTIVES": "To compare techniques of blood glucose monitoring and their impact on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.",
      "SEARCH METHODS": "We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (6 August 2013), searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted trial authors.",
      "SELECTION CRITERIA": "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing techniques of blood glucose monitoring including self blood glucose monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or clinic monitoring among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2). Trials investigating timing and frequency of monitoring were also included. Quasi-RCTs and RCTs using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.",
      "DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS": "Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy.",
      "MAIN RESULTS": "The search of the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register identified 21 trial reports. Following application of eligibility criteria, nine trials were included in this review. The included trials involved a total of 506 women (436 women with Type 1 diabetes and 70 women with Type 2 diabetes). All trials originated from European countries and the USA. None of the studies included women with gestational diabetes. Five of the nine included studies were at moderate risk of bias and four studies were at low to moderate risk of bias. Primary outcomes were maternal glycaemic control (fasting blood glucose and HbA1c) and infant birthweight or macrosomia.Various methods of glucose monitoring were compared in the trials. The following comparisons were included in the review: (1) self-monitoring versus standard care, (2) self-monitoring versus hospitalisation, (3) pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring, (4) automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system, (5) CGM versus intermittent monitoring and (6) constant CGM versus intermittent CGM.Neither pooled analyses nor individual trial analyses showed any significant advantages of one monitoring technique over another for primary outcomes (maternal glycaemic control and infant birthweight) and secondary outcomes such as gestational age at birth or preterm birth, frequency of neonatal hypoglycaemia, death of baby including stillbirth, and neonatal intensive care admission. Primary outcome data on macrosomia were reported by one trial but at a different cut-off value than that pre-specified for the review. Secondary outcomes such as shoulder dystocia, major and minor anomalies were not reported by any of the trials.",
      "AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS": "This review found no evidence that any glucose monitoring technique is superior to any other technique among pregnant women with pre-existing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The evidence base for the effectiveness of monitoring techniques is weak and additional evidence from large well-designed randomised trials is required to inform choices of glucose monitoring techniques."

      "BACKGROUND": "This novel study provides a time series analysis of tongue features extracted from a diabetic patient with pyogenic liver abscess (PLA), treated with the integration of western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The features, namely, tongue color, tongue fur thickness and fur color, identified from a series of tongue images taken every two days, exhibit significant transitions matching closely with the progression of disease. These tongue features could serve as effective, non-intrusive indices for different progression stages of diabetes with PLA.",
      "CASE PRESENTATION": "A 76-year-old male diabetic patient was admitted for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. Intermittent fever and abdominal discomfort were noted. After performing abdominal computed tomography and laboratory studies, the results indicated pyeogenic liver abscess, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae related. As PLA progressed, the patient suffered spiking fever and right upper abdominal pain. Tongue examination revealed features with red tongue, white-yellow and thick fur. After receiving pigtail catheter drainage, the fever subsided and the pus-like fluid was drained smoothly. During the course of this process, gradually dwindled tongue fur witnessed through periodic tongue examination coincides consistently with laboratory data, namely, body temperature, fasting plasma glucose and plasma glucose level gathered.",
      "CONCLUSION": "This is the first time series analysis of applying tongue examination to the progression of a specific disease. Through a series of tongue images taken periodically, tongue color, tongue fur thickness and fur color are identified to closely linked to the progression of diabetes with PLA, as indicated by data gathered through means of plasma glucose and abdominal sonographic follow-ups. Based on this promising finding, our future study will further extend the application of tongue assessment to evaluate the tongue characteristics of diabetic patients."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Pediatric obesity typically induces insulin resistance, often later evolving into type 2 diabetes. While exercise, enhancing insulin sensitivity, is broadly used to prevent this transition, it is unknown whether alterations in the exercise insulin response pattern occur in obese children. Therefore, we measured exercise insulin responses in 57 healthy weight (NW), 20 overweight (OW), and 56 obese (Ob) children. Blood samples were drawn before and after 30 min of intermittent (2 min on, 1 min off) cycling at ~80% VO2max. In a smaller group (14 NW, 6 OW, 15 Ob), a high-fat meal was ingested 45 min preexercise. Baseline glycemia was similar and increased slightly and similarly in all groups during exercise. Basal insulin (pmol/L) was significantly higher in Ob vs. other groups; postexercise, insulin increased in NW (+7± 3) and OW (+5 ± 8), but decreased in Ob (-15±5, p < .0167 vs. NW). This insulin drop in Ob was disproportionately more pronounced in the half of Ob children with higher basal insulin (Ob-H). In all groups, high-fat feeding caused a rapid rise in insulin, promptly corrected by exercise. In Ob, however, insulin rose again 30 min postexercise. Our data indicates a distinct pattern of exercise-induced insulin modulation in pediatric obesity, possibly modulated by basal insulin concentrations."

Dimethylarginines were measured in 783 of these subjects, and genotyping for tag SNPs in the DDAH1, DDAH2, and AGXT2 genes was performed in 935 subjects.",
      "RESULTS": "Plasma ADMA levels were significantly associated with SNPs in DDAH1 (top SNP rs1554597; P = 9.0E-09), while SDMA levels were associated with SNPs in AGXT2 (top SNP rs28305; P = 1.3E-04). Significant, independent determinants of plasma ADMA were sex, L-arginine, creatinine, fasting glucose, and rs1554597 (all P < 0.05; combined R(2) = 0.213). Determinants of SDMA were age, sex, creatinine, L-arginine, diabetes duration, prevalent CVD, and rs28305 (all P < 0.05; combined R(2) = 0.425). Neither dimethylarginine was associated with incident CVD. None of the investigated SNPs were associated with overall CVD, although subgroup analysis revealed a significant association of AGXT2 rs28305 with intermittent claudication.",

Although several studies have suggested that intermittent hypoxia in obstructive sleep apnea may induce abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, it remains to be determined whether these abnormalities improve after discontinuation of the exposure. The objective of this study was to delineate the effects of intermittent hypoxia on glucose homeostasis, beta cell function, and liver glucose metabolism and to investigate whether the impairments improve after the hypoxic exposure is discontinued.",

Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed to estimate whole-body insulin sensitivity and calculate measures of beta cell function. Oxidative stress in pancreatic tissue and glucose output from isolated hepatocytes were also assessed.",
      "RESULTS": "Intermittent hypoxia increased fasting glucose levels and worsened glucose tolerance by 67% and 27%, respectively. Furthermore, intermittent hypoxia exposure was associated with impairments in insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, an increase in liver glycogen, higher hepatocyte glucose output, and an increase in oxidative stress in the pancreas. While fasting glucose levels and hepatic glucose output normalized after discontinuation of the hypoxic exposure, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impairments in beta cell function persisted.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Intermittent hypoxia induces insulin resistance, impairs beta cell function, enhances hepatocyte glucose output, and increases oxidative stress in the pancreas. Cessation of the hypoxic exposure does not fully reverse the observed changes in glucose metabolism."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "What is the central question of this study? Periodic decreases in arterial blood O2 or chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is a hallmark feature of sleep apnoea patients. Despite a large body of clinical evidence linking sleep disordered breathing with apnoeas to diabetes, the causal relationships between CIH and β-cell function and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been established. What is the main finding and its importance? In a rodent model, we show that mitochondrial oxidative stress generated by CIH leads to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction manifested by augmented basal insulin secretion, insulin resistance, defective proinsulin processing and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The results of the present study provide evidence for direct effects of CIH on β-cell function, which may be an underlying molecular mechanism contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes among sleep apnoea patients. Breathing disorders with recurrent apnoea produce periodic decreases in arterial blood O2, i.e. chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Recurrent apnoea patients and CIH-exposed rodents exhibit several co-morbidities, including diabetes. However, the effects of CIH on pancreatic β-cell function are not known. In the present study, we investigated pancreatic β-cell function in C57BL6 mice exposed to 30 days of CIH. Compared with control animals, the CIH-exposed mice exhibited elevated levels of fasting plasma insulin but comparable glucose levels and higher homeostasis model assessment, indicating insulin resistance. Pancreatic β-cell morphology was unaltered in CIH-exposed mice. Insulin content was decreased in CIH-exposed β-cells, and this effect was associated with increased proinsulin levels. The mRNA and protein levels of the enzyme prohormone convertase 1, which converts proinsulin to insulin, were downregulated in CIH-treated islets. More importantly, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was impaired in CIH-exposed mice and in isolated islets. Mitochondrial levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were elevated in CIH-exposed pancreatic islets. Treatment of mice with mito-tempol, a scavenger of mitochondrial ROS, during exposure to CIH prevented the augmented insulin secretion and restored the proinsulin and homeostasis model assessment values to control levels. These results demonstrate that CIH leads to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, manifested by augmented basal insulin secretion, insulin resistance, defective proinsulin processing, impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increased mitochondrial ROS, which mediate the effects of CIH on pancreatic β-cell function."

      "CONCLUSION": "HyEx60 offered the greatest improvements in acute and moderate-term glucose control in T2D. Intermittent exercise stimulated glucose disposal and improved post-exercise insulin resistance, which was enhanced when exercise was combined with hypoxia (Hy5:5). The data suggest a use of hypoxic exercise in treatment of T2D."

    "title": "Continuous positive airway pressure treatment in patients with sleep apnoea: does it really improve glucose metabolism?",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder, characterised by repetitive episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep and associated with increasing respiratory efforts. These perturbations lead, in turn, to oxyhaemoglobin desaturation, sleep fragmentation, and daytime symptoms, mainly excessive sleepiness. Accumulating evidence suggests that intermittent hypoxia and oxyhaemoglobin desaturation may result, independently of obesity, in impaired glucose metabolism, as well as insulin resistance even in non-diabetic patients with OSAS. Additionally, OSAS has been proposed as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for OSAS, since it eliminates upper airway collapse during sleep and also improves sleep fragmentation, daytime symptoms and quality of life. Moreover, it has been proposed that the amelioration of breathing disturbances during sleep can improve several markers of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, such as glycated haemoglobin, fasting glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance. Indeed, some studies have reported improvements in these parameters especially in compliant patients. However, other works failed to confirm this beneficial effect. The present article reviews the issue whether CPAP treatment exerts a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance."

    "abstract": {
      "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS": "Although the associations between obstructive sleep apnoea and type 2 diabetes mellitus have been reported in cross-sectional design studies, findings on the prospective association between the two conditions are limited. We examined prospectively the association between nocturnal intermittent hypoxia as a surrogate marker of obstructive sleep apnoea and risk of type 2 diabetes.",
      "METHODS": "A total of 4,398 community residents aged 40 to 69 years who had participated in sleep investigation studies between 2001 and 2005 were enrolled. Nocturnal intermittent hypoxia was assessed by pulse-oximetry and defined by the number of oxygen desaturation measurements < or =3% per h, with five to <15 per h corresponding to mild and 15 events or more per h corresponding to moderate-to-severe nocturnal intermittent hypoxia, respectively. The development of type 2 diabetes was defined by: (1) fasting serum glucose > or =7.00 mmol/l (126 mg/dl); (2) non-fasting serum glucose > or =11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl); and/or (3) initiation of glucose-lowering medication or insulin therapy. Multivariable model accounted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, current alcohol intake, community, borderline type 2 diabetes, habitual snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep duration and (for women) menopausal status.",
      "RESULTS": "By the end of 2007, 92.2% of participants had been followed up (median follow-up duration [interquartile range] 3.0 [2.9-4.0] years) and 210 persons identified as having developed diabetes. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) for developing type 2 diabetes was 1.26 (0.91-1.76) among those with mild nocturnal intermittent hypoxia and 1.69 (1.04-2.76) among those with moderate-to-severe nocturnal intermittent hypoxia (p = 0.03 for trend).",
      "CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION": "Nocturnal intermittent hypoxia was associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes among middle-aged Japanese."

      "SUMMARY": "Nurse-led assessment/management of risk factors is effective in many chronic medical conditions. We aimed to evaluate whether this finding was true for patients with intermittent claudication and to analyze its impact on patient-reported quality of life and predicted mortality due to coronary heart disease. We prospectively studied a series of 78 patients (51 men; median age, 65 years [IQR: 56-74 years]), diagnosed with intermittent claudication and referred to a nurse-led risk assessment/management clinic (NLC) from a consultant-led vascular surgical clinic. The NLC used clinical care pathways to manage antiplatelet medication, smoking cessation, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes and to provide exercise advice. All patients were reassessed at a 3 months. Medication compliance, smoking status, fasting lipid profiles, blood pressure, and HbA1c were recorded. Disease-specific quality of life was assessed using King's College VascuQoL and predicted cardiac morbidity and mortality were calculated using the PROCAM and Framingham risk scores. We found that NLC enrollment produced an antiplatelet and a statin compliance of 100%, a smoking cessation rate of 17% (9 patients) and significant improvements in total cholesterol (median, 5.2-4.5 mmol/l), LDL (median, 3.1-2.5 mmol/l) and triglyceride (median, 1.7-1.4 mmol/l) levels. Significant disease-specific quality of life improvements and significant reduction in both the PROCAM (14% to 10%) and Framingham (14% to 11%) coronary risk scores were observed. Providing care at NLCs for claudicants is effective in assessing and managing risk factors, improves disease-specific quality of life and reduces predicted morbidity and mortality due to coronary heart disease."

The first one aged 31 with diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and diabetes mellitus presented with calf intermittent claudication as a result of tibial arteries occlusions. The second one aged 34 with impaired fasting glycemia and without any sign of GHD presented with sudden calf pain as a result of tibial posterior arterial acute occlusion. These cases support the hypothesis that in GH deficiency patients is a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus and early atherosclerosis and they are more vulnerable to vascular thrombotic events (Tab. 1, Ref. 5)."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "To compare the effects of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and postprandial hyperglycemia on monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, we investigated the effects of twice-daily standard diet (5% fat) and high-fat diet (30% fat) for 3 weeks on monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and the expression of adhesion molecules in the aortic artery in non-obese type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. Fasting glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), HbA1c, and body weight were comparable between the two diet groups. Postprandial glucose and insulin were higher in the standard diet group, while postprandial NEFA and triglyceride were higher in the high fat diet group, compared with the other group. The number of monocyte adherent to endothelial cells was higher in the high-fat diet group than the standard diet group. Consumption of high-fat diet resulted in overexpression of heme oxygenase-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and connecting segment-1 fibronectin on the arterial wall, compared with standard diet. Thus, our data demonstrated that short-term intermittent high-fat diet prevented postprandial hyperglycemia in a model of type 2 diabetes without a significant increase in body weight. However, the resulting postprandial hypertriglyceridemia induces more monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells than postprandial hyperglycemia. This increased monocyte adhesion is associated with the increased aortic expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, and connecting segment-1 fibronectin."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the principal extra-pulmonary complication of cystic fibrosis, occurring in 15-30% of adult cystic fibrosis patients. The number of cystic fibrosis patients who develop diabetes is increasing in parallel with increases in life expectancy. The aim of this study was to review the physiopathology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of CFRD. A bibliographic search of the Medline and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature databases was made. Articles were selected from among those published in the last twenty years. Insulin deficiency, caused by reduced beta-cell mass, is the main etiologic mechanism, although insulin resistance also plays a role. Presenting features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, CFRD typically affects individuals of approximately 20 years of age. It can also be accompanied by fasting, non-fasting or intermittent hyperglycemia. Glucose intolerance is associated with worsening of nutritional status, increased morbidity, decreased survival and reduced pulmonary function. Microvascular complications are always present, although macrovascular complications are rarely seen. An oral glucose tolerance test is recommended annually for patients > or = 10 years of age and for any patients presenting unexplained weight loss or symptoms of diabetes. Patients hospitalized with severe diseases should also be screened. If fasting hyperglycemia persists for more than 48 h, insulin therapy is recommended. Insulin administration remains the treatment of choice for diabetes and fasting hyperglycemia. Calories should not be restricted, and patients with CFRD should be managed by a multidisciplinary team."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Short-term elevations of stress hormones cause an increase in glycemia. However, the effect of intermittent stress on development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is unclear. We hypothesized that recurrent intermittent restraint stress would deteriorate glycemia. Male, prediabetic Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were restrained 1 hour per day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks and compared with unstressed, age-matched diabetic controls and lean nondiabetic rats. To differentiate the effects of recurrent restraint stress per se vs restraint-induced inhibition of food intake, a pair-fed group of rats was included. Surprisingly, recurrent restraint and pair feeding delayed fed and fasting hyperglycemia, such that they were lowered 50% by restraint and 30% by pair feeding after 13 weeks. Rats that were previously restrained or pair fed had lower glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test, but restraint further improved the return of glucose to baseline compared to pair feeding (P<.05). This was despite pair-fed rats having slightly lowered food intake and body weights compared with restrained rats. Restraint and pair feeding did not alter insulin responses to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) or fasting insulin, and did not lower plasma lipids. Interestingly, restraint normalized basal corticosterone to one third that in control and pair-fed rats, prevented increases in pretreatment corticosterone seen with pair feeding, and led to habituation of restraint-induced corticosterone responses. After 13 weeks of treatment, multiple regression analysis showed that elevations in basal corticosterone could explain approximately 20% of the variance in fed glucose levels. In summary, intermittent restraint and its adaptations delayed hyperglycemia and improved glucose control in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. These benefits can be partially explained by restraint-induced lowering of food intake, but additional improvements compared to pair feeding may involve lower overall corticosterone exposure with repeated restraint. Paradoxically, these novel investigations suggest some types of occasional stress may limit development of diabetes."

Family history of diabetes, smoking, height, weight, waistline, fasting glycaemia, glycosylated haemoglobin, total and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride values were collected. Claudication, cyanosis, cold foot, foot hair anomalies, skin thinning and femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were assessed. The ABI was measured with a portable Doppler continuous-wave instrument.",
      "RESULTS": "An ABI < 0.9 was found in 539 (21.1%) patients. Claudication was present in 187 (7.3%). Femoral pulse was absent in 218 (8.5%), popliteal in 316 (12.3%), tibial in 563 (22.0%) and dorsalis pedis in 578 (22.6%).

      "SUMMARY": "The size and frequency of meals are fundamental aspects of nutrition that can have profound effects on the health and longevity of laboratory animals. In humans, excessive energy intake is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers and is a major cause of disability and death in industrialized countries. On the other hand, the influence of meal frequency on human health and longevity is unclear. Both caloric (energy) restriction (CR) and reduced meal frequency/intermittent fasting can suppress the development of various diseases and can increase life span in rodents by mechanisms involving reduced oxidative damage and increased stress resistance. Many of the beneficial effects of CR and fasting appear to be mediated by the nervous system. For example, intermittent fasting results in increased production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which increases the resistance of neurons in the brain to dysfunction and degeneration in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders; BDNF signaling may also mediate beneficial effects of intermittent fasting on glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. A better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms by which meal size and frequency affect human health may lead to novel approaches for disease prevention and treatment."

    "title": "The pathophysiological basis for intensive insulin replacement.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Both type I and type II diabetes are characterised by a progressive decrease in beta-cell function and mass. In type I diabetes, autoimmune destruction results in rapid loss of beta-cell function, and insulin therapy is essential to maintain normoglycaemia. In type II diabetes, a diminished or absent first-phase insulin release is the earliest metabolic defect, which is accompanied by lack of prandial suppression of hepatic glucose production, increased postprandial glucose excursions and late insulin hypersecretion. Furthermore, chronic exposure to elevated glucose, even to intermittent postprandial spikes, results in further deterioration of the beta-cell function ('glucotoxicity'). By the time type II diabetes is diagnosed, beta-cell function and mass have declined by about 50%. With the progression of the disease and glucotoxicity there is continuous decrease in beta-cell mass due to increased apoptosis that results in absolute insulin deficiency. By then, patients require insulin administration to maintain glucose control. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates the importance of preserving endogenous beta-cell function both in type I and type II diabetes. Early and intensive glycaemic control, using regimens which re-create a physiological insulin profile, controlling postprandial as well as fasting glucose levels, offers the most promise for preserving beta-cell function, decreasing disease progression, and reducing the chronic complications of diabetes."

      "SUMMARY": "Increasing evidence supports a role for glycated insulin in the insulin-resistant state of type 2 diabetes. We measured 24-hour profiles of plasma glycated insulin, using a novel radioimmunoassay (RIA), to evaluate the effects of meal stimulation and intermittent fasting on circulating concentrations of plasma glycated insulin in type 2 diabetes. Patients (n = 6; hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)], 7.2% +/- 0.6%; fasting plasma glucose, 7.4 +/- 0.7 mmol/L; body mass index [BMI], 35.7 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2); age, 56.3 +/- 4.4 years) were admitted for 24 hours and received a standardized meal regimen. Half-hourly venous samples were taken for plasma glycated insulin, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations between 8 am and midnight and 2-hourly overnight. The mean plasma glycated insulin concentration over 24 hours was 27.8 +/- 1.2 pmol/L with a mean ratio of insulin:glycated insulin of 11:1. Circulating glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glycated insulin followed a basal and meal-related pattern with most prominent increments following breakfast, lunch, and evening meal, respectively. The mean concentrations of glycated insulin during the morning, afternoon, evening, and night-time periods were 24.4 +/- 2.5, 28.7 +/- 2.3, 31.1 +/- 2.1, and 26.2 +/- 1.5 pmol/L, respectively, giving significantly higher molar ratios of insulin:glycated insulin of 18.0:1, 14.2:1, and 12.7:1 compared with 7.0:1 at night (P <.01 to P <.001). These data demonstrate that glycated insulin circulates at relatively high concentrations in type 2 diabetes with a diurnal pattern of basal and meal-stimulated release. A higher proportion of glycated insulin circulates at night suggestive of differences in metabolic clearance compared with native insulin."

      "SUMMARY": "Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare form of juvenile diabetes mellitus, defined by early onset, absence of ketosis, non-insulin-dependent diabetes and autosomal dominant inheritance. Advances in molecular genetic analysis have identified mutations accounting for different MODY subtypes, all of them associated with defects of insulin secretion. We present a case of a nine year-old boy, admitted to our outpatient clinic because of mild and intermittent osmotic symptoms (polyuria, polyphagia and polydipsia) and persistently high values of fasting blood glucose in the last year. He had a family history of diabetes in three consecutive generations compatible with autossomal dominant inheritance. His height was 138.5 cm (90th centile) and his weight was 33.5 Kg (90th centile). General examination was unremarkable, in a prepubertal boy. A standard oral glucose tolerance test was performed. The fasting blood glucose was 118 mg/dl with a two hour value of 160 mg/dl. ICA, IAA and GAD autoantibodies were undetectable. He started on diet therapy, keeping his fasting blood glucose measurements on the upper limits of normal and HbA1c in the normal range. He was diagnosed as having MODY 2 on a clinical basis, as it is not possible to perform molecular analysis of this pathology in Portugal. As MODY is recently thought to account for 2-5% of all cases of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus it is important to consider it as a possible diagnosis in children who present with incidental hyperglycaemia. Molecular genetic testing is very important as it enables us to make a firm diagnosis of MODY, to define a follow up plan and to reassure patients families, once the prognosis is significantly different among the different sub-types of MODY. We emphathize the need of creating national and international reference centres where such testing can be done."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Although all cells in the body require energy to survive and function properly, excessive calorie intake over long time periods can compromise cell function and promote disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and cancers. Accordingly, dietary restriction (DR; either caloric restriction or intermittent fasting, with maintained vitamin and mineral intake) can extend lifespan and can increase disease resistance. Recent studies have shown that DR can have profound effects on brain function and vulnerability to injury and disease. DR can protect neurons against degeneration in animal models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and stroke. Moreover, DR can stimulate the production of new neurons from stem cells (neurogenesis) and can enhance synaptic plasticity, which may increase the ability of the brain to resist aging and restore function following injury. Interestingly, increasing the time interval between meals can have beneficial effects on the brain and overall health of mice that are independent of cumulative calorie intake. The beneficial effects of DR, particularly those of intermittent fasting, appear to be the result of a cellular stress response that stimulates the production of proteins that enhance neuronal plasticity and resistance to oxidative and metabolic insults; they include neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protein chaperones such as heat-shock proteins, and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. Some beneficial effects of DR can be achieved by administering hormones that suppress appetite (leptin and ciliary neurotrophic factor) or by supplementing the diet with 2-deoxy-d-glucose, which may act as a calorie restriction mimetic. The profound influences of the quantity and timing of food intake on neuronal function and vulnerability to disease have revealed novel molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby diet affects the nervous system, and are leading to novel preventative and therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders."

The study of the actions of tumour necrosing factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), classically implicated in inflammatory processes and in fighting infection, has revealed numerous metabolic effects. Some gene polymorphisms of TNF-alpha and IL-6 (associated with a different TNF-alpha or IL-6 transcription rate) and the plasma concentrations of the soluble TNF-alpha receptor are found to be simultaneously associated with resistance to insulin, the proportion of body fat and with the mortality linked with different chronic infections. Therefore, it seems that the immune system is designed to fight infections effectively and to provide certain survival advantages during periods of intermittent fasting so frequent in the past. By inducing a resistance to insulin in the muscles, the energy substrates would thus be reserved for neuronal metabolism. In the presence of an insulin-resistance genotype and a westernization of the environment (carbohydrate-rich diet, an increase in saturated fat, low fibre and sedentary lifestyle), a genotype with a high cytokine response will contribute to a worsening of the resistance to insulin and, finally, to type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. The advantages for our ancestors of a large cytokine response (eradication of the lesion) or moderate resistance to insulin (protection against food shortage) have led in the present day to the development of atherosclerosis now that the characteristics of the environment have changed. It is contended that these changes constitute examples of good adaptation to the environment or poor concordance between our current lifestyle and our genome."

    "abstract": {
      "OBJECTIVE": "To determine whether an intermittent very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) improves weight loss and glycemic control more than moderate caloric restriction alone.",
      "RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS": "Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n = 54) who were > or = 20% over ideal body weight participated in a 20-week behavioral weight control program. Subjects were randomized to either a standard behavioral therapy (SBT) group or to one of two VLCD groups. SBT subjects received a 1,500-1,800 kcal/day diet throughout. Both VLCD groups followed a VLCD for 5 consecutive days during week 2, followed by either intermittent VLCD therapy for 1 day/week for 15 weeks (1-day) or for 5 consecutive days every 5 weeks (5-day), with a 1,500-1,800 kcal/day diet at other times.",
      "RESULTS": "Both VLCD groups lost more weight than the SBT group over the 20 weeks (P = 0.04). Although the groups did not differ in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) changes at 20 weeks, more subjects in the 5-day group attained a normal HbA1c when compared with the SBT group (P = 0.04). This benefit was independent of the effects of weight loss. The best predictor of overall change in FPG and HbA1c was the FPG response during the first 3 weeks of the program.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Periodic VLCDs improved weight loss in diabetic subjects. A regimen with intermittent 5-day VLCD therapy seemed particularly promising, because more subjects in this group attained a normal HbA1c. Moreover, the glucose response to a 3-week period of diet therapy predicted glycemic response at 20 weeks, and it was a better predictor of the 20-week response than initial or overall weight loss."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) might play an important role in lipoprotein metabolism, including modulation of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein catabolism, reverse cholesterol transport and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. Increased apoA-IV levels have been reported in plasma from NIDDM patients. The aim of the present study was to look for a possible association between plasma apoA-IV level and prevalence of macrovascular disease in NIDDM. One hundred and thirty-six NIDDM patients were studied (71 men, 65 women). Macrovascular disease was assessed in each patient by a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, resting electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory evaluation (ankle/arm blood pressure ratio, continuous wave Doppler velocimetry). Moreover, patients without any history of coronary heart disease and showing a normal resting ECG underwent a bicycle exercise test or a dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy to detect possible silent myocardial ischemia. Among the 136 NIDDM patients, 56 had macrovascular disease. ApoA-IV levels were significantly higher in NIDDM patients with macrovascular disease than in NIDDM patients without macrovascular disease (20.9 +/- 8.6 vs. 13.3 +/- 5.3 mg/dl; P < 0.001). The influence of different factors, such as age, BMI, cigarette smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, apoA-IV level, apoA-IV phenotype, fasting glycemia, fasting C-peptide, and microalbuminuria, on the prevalence of macrovascular disease was analyzed using a logistic regression model. In the univariate analysis, apoA-IV level (P < 0.00001), age (P = 0.0087), hypertension (P = 0.012), microalbuminuria (P = 0.018), triglycerides (P = 0.02), and fasting C-peptide (P = 0.03) were positively associated with macrovascular disease. In the multivariate analysis, macrovascular disease was positively associated only with apoA-IV (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.003) and negatively associated with HDL cholesterol (P = 0.013). These results indicate that increased plasma apoA-IV level is associated with an increased prevalence of macrovascular disease in NIDDM. Moreover, apoA-IV, in NIDDM patients, appears to be a better marker for macrovascular disease than triglycerides."

Patients received 14 days twice a day (BID) of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g GLY-200 or PBO (1:1:1:1). The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Additional endpoints included changes in plasma glucose (secondary) and calories and lipid profiles (exploratory).",
      "RESULTS": "GLY-200 appeared safe and well tolerated. The most frequently related TEAEs in subjects treated with GLY-200 were constipation, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting, all of which were mild. Improvements in fasting and postprandial glucose were observed. For 2.0 g Day 14 postprandial glucose post-standardized meal, mean absolute AUC",

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), recurrent episodes of intermittent hypoxia may stimulate BDNF expression as a compensatory neuroprotective response. OSA is associated with metabolic disturbances, such as increased insulin resistance and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy may influence both BDNF levels and metabolic outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in BDNF concentration and glucose metabolism in patients with OSA, with particular emphasis on the effect of long-term CPAP therapy. Sixty-six adult patients with OSA confirmed by polysomnography were enrolled and divided into severe (s-OSA) and non-severe (ns-OSA) groups. Fasting blood samples were collected to measure glucose, insulin, and BDNF concentrations. Patients with s-OSA were re-evaluated after 12 months of CPAP therapy and further classified as compliant (sc-OSA) or non-compliant (snc-OSA) based on recorded device usage. The same biochemical parameters were assessed after the 12-month follow-up. Baseline BDNF levels were significantly higher in the s-OSA group compared to the ns-OSA group (20.1 ng/mL vs. 8.1 ng/mL, "

      "INTRODUCTION": "Whereas fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is cheaper, the glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) test, which does not require fasting, is more convenient for diabetes screening and could be available to patients throughout the day. In this study, we compared the cost effectiveness of the HBA1c test to that of the FPG test when used for point-of-care (POC) screening of type 2 diabetes in a low-resource setting in Uganda.",
      "METHODS": "A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was conducted for a single screening cycle of 1659 adults aged 35-70 years receiving care at the outpatient department of a general hospital. We constructed a decision analysis model using TreeAge Pro Healthcare v2023, with the cost estimated using an ingredient approach and the effectiveness measured based on the proportion of patients correctly diagnosed with diabetes.",
      "RESULTS": "The unit cost was US$ 6.48 for the HBA1c test and US$ 8.39 for the FPG test. However, a marginally greater percentage of patients were correctly diagnosed according to the FPG test (96.3%) than the HBA1c test (96.2%). The cost-effectiveness ratio was $6.74 for the HBA1c test and $8.39 for the FPG test. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was $989.06 per additional patient correctly diagnosed with diabetes.",
      "CONCLUSION": "HBA1c POC testing could be a more cost-effective alternative to the FPG POC test for the screening of diabetes in under-served outpatient populations in Uganda and similar contexts."

      "SUMMARY": "During 2024, there were many practice-changing innovations in the field of endocrinology, particularly related to the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). From the substantial new evidence published in 2024, 10 studies are highlighted that offer critical information for clinicians who manage or comanage patients with endocrine disorders including prediabetes, diabetes, obesity, and hyperparathyroidism. Two of the 10 articles are focused on use of GLP-1RAs in multiple clinical settings not studied in the original GLP-1RA trials, including after bariatric surgery and before endoscopy. Two additional studies focused on GLP-1RA explore the risk for thyroid cancer in patients prescribed GLP-1RA and the effect of a GLP-1RA on chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Three articles investigate opportunities for deintensification of insulin frequency or an alternate method of insulin delivery in patients with type 2 diabetes. One article explores the cardiometabolic effects of intermittent fasting in persons with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The last 2 articles explore the incidence of diabetes after SARS-CoV-2 infection and the skeletal effects of parathyroidectomy as a treatment of hyperparathyroidism. The results of each study have a direct effect on the delivery of care for patients with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and hyperparathyroidism."

The limitations of traditional treatments like ACE inhibitors and ARBs in managing DKD progression highlight the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. This review examines the impact of various dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting, DASH diet, and vegetarian diet, on the management of DKD. Evidence suggests these diets can halt the progression of DKD, although further research is needed to confirm their long-term effectiveness and safety.

We previously reported pilot data from a 6-month intervention in which a self-insured manufacturing company partnered with a metabolic health clinic that utilizes therapeutic carbohydrate reduction (TCR), asynchronous monitoring, and a community-based approach to treat employees with metabolic disease. This manuscript presents weight loss and cost-savings from deprescription at the 12-month time point.",
      "METHODS": "50 employees, mean BMI 43.2 ± 8.7 kg/m",
      "RESULTS": "41 completed the one-year intervention. Mean weight loss for the 50 subjects in the intention-to-treat analysis was 19.5 ± 11.4 kg, corresponding to 15.5% total body weight loss with concomitant deprescription of 96 medications, while starting only 8 medications. In patients who discontinued GLP-1 receptor agonists, weight loss continued or was maintained. Annualized cost savings from the TOWARD approach were approximately -$1700 per patient, as compared to an annualized cost burden of roughly +$13000 per patient for a GLP-1 receptor agonist.",
      "CONCLUSION": "The TOWARD approach represents a scalable metabolic health intervention that demonstrates robust improvements in weight while simultaneously allowing for deprescription leading to substantial cost savings. TOWARD could serve as a scalable tool to facilitate intensive lifestyle intervention with efficacy on par with GLP-1 receptor agonists."

      "METHODS AND PROCEDURES": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two normal and four obese groups. Obese prediabetes was induced by feeding a high-fat diet and sucrose water (HFSD) for 10 weeks; normal rats were given a standard diet and plain water. For the next 6 weeks, rats were grouped into the normal group (NR), which continued on the standard diet; the normal group was switched to TRF with the standard diet (NR + TRFSD); the prediabetes group (OR) was continued on HFSD; the prediabetes group was switched to TRF of HFSD (OR + TRFHFSD); the prediabetes group was switched to TRF of the standard diet (OR + TRFSD); and the prediabetes group was switched to the standard diet (OR + SD). Rats were then sacrificed, and aortic tissues were isolated and quantified for oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde, antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase, and inflammation markers tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin 1. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), body weight, Lee's index, serum insulin level, and resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance) were also measured.",
      "RESULTS": "Mean FBG and body weight in obese groups were higher compared to the normal groups after 10 weeks of HFDSD. Both obese-prediabetes groups that underwent TRF had reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1, body weight, Lee's index, FBG, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, obese prediabetes on TRF with SD also reduced levels of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde), insulin levels and increased levels of the antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase).",

This study aimed to explore MADF's effects on DKD in db/db mice, a model for the condition, and to investigate its underlying mechanisms.",
      "METHODS": "We implemented an MADF regimen in db/db mice on a high-fat diet, measuring blood glucose, body weight, and renal function at various times. After the intervention, we analyzed the proteome and metabolome of renal tissues.",
      "RESULTS": "MADF was found to reduce hyperglycemia and slow the pathological progression of DKD in the mice. Proteomic analysis identified 165 proteins that increased and 196 that decreased in the kidneys of db/db mice compared to controls. MADF intervention led to a decrease in 26 of the increased proteins and an increase in 18 of the decreased ones. Notably, many of these proteins, including cathepsin S (CTSS), were related to lysosomes, suggesting a role in renal protection. Metabolomic profiling revealed changes in metabolites associated with inflammation, such as prostaglandin A1, which was downregulated in db/db mice and upregulated with MADF. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the expression changes of CTSS observed in the proteomic data. Additionally, CTSS expression was found to increase in renal cells exposed to high glucose and palmitic acid.",
      "CONCLUSION": "MADF appears to mitigate the progression of DKD, with proteomic evidence pointing to lysosome-related proteins like CTSS as potential mediators of its renal protective effects. These findings indicate that MADF and the inhibition of CTSS could be considered as novel therapeutic strategies for DKD treatment."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is a complex clinical disorder characterized by the interplay between heart and kidney dysfunction. This condition is exacerbated by comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, which contribute to glucose-mediated oxidative stress, further complicating the management of CRS. The management of CRS has evolved with the discovery of sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which have been established as effective agents in reducing hyperglycemia and demonstrated cardiorenal protective effects. Concurrently, intermittent fasting has gained attention as an intervention without pharmacological treatment for its metabolic benefits, including improved glucose metabolism and insulin regulation and sensitivity, both with a potential reduction in oxidative stress. This review provides a summary of current findings on the roles of SGLT2 inhibitors and intermittent fasting in managing CRS, with a particular focus on glucose-mediated oxidative stress. We evaluate the mechanisms by which these interventions exert their effects, identify gaps in current research, and offer recommendations for future studies. While both SGLT2 inhibitors and intermittent fasting demonstrate potential in managing CRS, more research is needed to elucidate their long-term efficacy, safety, and potential synergistic effects."

Their place of residence, categorized as a yes/no predominantly Muslim-Arab city, was identified for analysis purposes. Data regarding fasting plasma glucose and HbA1C levels were extracted from the 90 days preceding and the 45 days following the Ramadan period, spanning across six years (2011-2016). The annual data were aggregated and analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA.",
      "RESULTS": "Muslim participants during Ramadan were found to have a higher likelihood of experiencing a change in HbA1C levels of ≥ 0.5 % compared to their non-Muslim counterparts, displaying an odds ratio (OR) of 1.89 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-2.88). Among Muslims with initially normal HbA1C levels (≤7 %), there was a heightened risk of both decreased (≤-0.5 %) HbA1C levels (OR=2.62, 95 % CI: 1.15-6.00) and increased (≥+0.5 %) HbA1C levels (OR=2.85, 95 % CI: 1.24-6.57) in comparison to the non-Muslim group.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "In Muslims with type 2 diabetes, fasting during the Ramadan increases the risk of their HbA1C-levels rising by more than 0.5 %. These results underscore the potentially dual impact of Ramadan intermittent fasting on glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is a nutritional lifestyle intervention with broad metabolic benefits, but whether the impact of IF depends on the individual's age is unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of IF on systemic metabolism and β cell function in old, middle-aged, and young mice. Short-term IF improves glucose homeostasis across all age groups without altering islet function and morphology. In contrast, while chronic IF is beneficial for adult mice, it results in impaired β cell function in the young. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we delineate that the β cell maturation and function scores are reduced in young mice. In human islets, a similar pattern is observed in type 1 (T1D), but not type 2 (T2D), diabetes, suggesting that the impact of chronic IF in adolescence is linked to the development of β cell dysfunction. Our study suggests considering the duration of IF in younger persons, as it may worsen rather than reduce diabetes outcomes."

      "OBJECTIVE": "Effective methods for establishing an aged animal model of diabetes and glycemic fluctuation have rarely been investigated. The aim of the study was to explore the feasibility of inducing glycemic fluctuation in aged Sprague-Dawley rats and to evaluate the corresponding changes in cognitive function.",
      "METHODS": "Male rats aged 48 weeks were fed a high-fat and high-glucose diet and given streptozotocin intraperitoneally to establish a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Then, glycemic fluctuation was induced via three different protocols: (1) intraperitoneal injection of glucose; (2) sequential fasting, insulin injection, and normal diet; and (3) intermittent intraperitoneal injections of glucose and insulin.",
      "RESULTS": "All three protocols were effective at inducing glycemic fluctuation in aged rats with T2DM, with successful modeling rates of 60 %, 90 %, and 70 %, respectively. Aged T2DM rats with glycemic fluctuation showed significant increases in glycemic variability compared with controls, including in the mean blood glucose, postprandial glycemic excursion, largest amplitude of glycemic excursion, and standard deviation of blood glucose values (all P < 0.05). Additionally, rats with glycemic fluctuation had more severe insulin resistance and dyslipidemia (P < 0.05). Morris water maze testing showed a trend of longer escape latency in the navigation test for rats in the glycemic fluctuation groups, suggesting impaired cognitive function. Pathological analysis showed degenerative changes in the CA1 hippocampal region of rats in the glycemic fluctuation groups. Finally, differential gene expression analysis revealed 1323 significantly altered genes in the GV group, with 691 upregulated and 632 downregulated. The dysregulated genes were predominantly associated with the axon guidance pathway and potassium channel regulation.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "The proposed protocols were effective at establishing an aged T2DM rat model with glycemic fluctuation, and rats with glycemic fluctuation exhibited diminished cognitive function."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Nucleotide availability is crucial for DNA replication and repair; however, the coordinating mechanisms in vivo remain unclear. Here, we show that the circadian clock in the liver controls the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to support de novo nucleotide biosynthesis for DNA synthesis demands. We demonstrate that disrupting the hepatic clock by genetic manipulation or mistimed feeding impairs PPP activity in male mice, leading to nucleotide imbalance. Such defects not only elicit DNA replication stress to limit liver regeneration after resection but also allow genotoxin-induced hepatocyte senescence and STING signalling-dependent inflammation. Mechanistically, the molecular clock activator BMAL1 synergizes with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to regulate the transcription of the PPP rate-limiting enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which is enhanced during liver regeneration. Overexpressing G6PD restores the compromised regenerative capacity of the BMAL1- or HIF-1α-deficient liver. Moreover, boosting G6PD expression genetically or through preoperative intermittent fasting potently facilitates liver repair in normal mice. Hence, our findings highlight the physiological importance of the hepatic clock and suggest a promising pro-regenerative strategy."

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on heart tissue structure, the serum level of FGF21 and the heart tissue level of β-Klotho, an FGF21 coreceptor, in HFD and HFD + STZ-induced diabetic mice.",
      "METHODS": "Thirty-six male C57BL/6J mice were divided into high-fat diet (HFD) and normal chow diet (ND) groups. After 20 weeks of diet, the HFD mice were divided into HFD and HFD + STZ groups, and the latter group was injected with STZ. Then, the mice in the ND, HFD and HFD + STZ groups were divided into three subgroups of control (C), HIIT and MICT, and mice were placed in one of nine groups ND-C, ND-HIIT, ND-MICT, HFD-C, HFD-HIIT, HFD-MICT, HFD + STZ-C, HFD + STZ-HIIT, and HFD + STZ-MICT. The mice in the exercise training (ET) groups were run on a treadmill for eight weeks. Finally, the tissue and serum samples were collected and analyzed by two-way ANOVA.",
      "RESULTS": "Statistical analyses showed that the main effect of diabetes inducing model (DIM) was significant for all variables (p < 0.05), except vascular density (p = 0.055); the main effect of ET type on fasting blood glucose and FGF21 was significant (p < 0.001); and the interaction was significant for fasting blood glucose, heart weight and FGF21 (p < 0.001). Post hoc and subgroup analysis showed a superior effect of MICT over HIIT in decreasing fasting blood glucose and serum level of FGF21 (p < 0.001). Additionally, the results of the myocardial tissue qualitative analyses differed between the diabetic mouse models and the ET groups.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "In a mouse model, type 2 diabetes can negatively affect heart tissue structure and FGF21 signaling in cardiac tissue, and both HIIT and MICT can prevent this effect. However, MICT likely more effective that HIIT in reducing circulating FGF21."

However, it is still unclear whether those health benefits are independent of caloric restriction (CR)-induced weight loss. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare isocaloric IF and CR regarding anthropometric measurements, adherence, metabolic profile, inflammatory biomarkers, and adipokines in adults and elderlies.",
      "METHODS AND RESULTS": "Comprehensive research was conducted usin four major databases including Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar without date restriction. Mean differences of the change from baseline ± change SD were calculated as the differences between IF and CR groups. Subgroup analysis was performed according to intervention duration (short-, medium-, and long-term). To determine the reliability of our findings, GRADE assessment was performed. As a result, 20 RCTs were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. IF groups had significant reductions in fat mass (kg) (P = 0.006) and Interleukin-6 (P < 0.00001) in the short term and fat mass (%) (P = 0.0002), waist circumference (P = 0.005), fasting blood insulin (P < 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.04) in the long term. CR groups had significantly lower hunger (P = 0.003), fatigue (P = 0.04), and TG (P = 0.03).",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "IF may be an effective alternative to CR but is not superior to CR in enhancing human health. Due to the low number of long-term studies, future studies should focus on conducting longitudinal randomized trials comparing IF and CR in different populations, age groups, and IF patterns."

      "SUMMARY": "Obesity and its associated intestinal inflammatory responses represent a significant global challenge. (IF) is a dietary intervention demonstrating various health benefits, including weight loss, enhanced metabolic health, and increased longevity. However, its effect on the intestinal inflammation induced by high-fat diet (HFD) is still not fully comprehended. Thirty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: Control (fed standard chow diet for 24 weeks); the HFD group (fed HFD for 24 weeks); and the HFD + IF group (fed HFD for 12 weeks, followed by an alternate day regimen of fasting and HFD for 12 weeks). The results revealed that IF significantly reduced body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels compared to the HFD group. Furthermore, rats undergoing the intermittent fasting regimen exhibited a significant reduction in resting time, along with increased durations of grooming and exploration when compared to those on HFD. IF significantly reduced HFD-induced intestinal oxidative stress by lowering malondialdehyde levels and substantially increasing intestinal total antioxidant capacity, consistent with histopathological findings of gastric and intestinal tissues. The investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that IF significantly increased the intestinal expression of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R), with a significant decrease in gastrointestinal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) compared to the HFD group. The findings indicate that IF can mitigate HFD-induced intestinal inflammation via the FXR/GLP-1/MC4R/ PPAR-γ pathway. This highlights the need for further research to elucidate these mechanisms."

      "SUMMARY": "Ischemic stroke (IS) remains a global health issue because of its great disability and mortality. Energy restriction (ER) has been justified to perform an inhibitory role in cerebral injury caused by IS. This research was purposed to inquire the potential molecular mechanism of ER in IS. To verify the function of ER in the animal and cell models of IS, rats were subjected to intermittent fasting (IF) and middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) surgery and HAPI cells were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). It was disclosed that IF mitigated brain damage and inflammation in MCAO/R rats. Likewise, ER inhibited OGD/R-evoked microglial activation and inflammatory response. Of note, ubiquitin specific protease 18 (USP18) was uncovered to be the most significantly upregulated in MCAO/R rats receiving IF compared to free-feeding MCAO/R rats. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot verified that ER led to the promotion of USP18 expression. Moreover, downregulation of USP18 neutralized the meliorative effects of ER on OGD/R-treated HAPI cells. Functionally, USP18 restrained β-catenin ubiquitination to enhance its expression. In addition, our results manifested that S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (SKP2) contributed to degradation of β-catenin and USP18 abolished the role of SKP2 in β-catenin ubiquitination. Knockout of USP18 eliminated the protective effects of IF on MCAO/R rats, while SKP2 exacerbated brain damage and inflammation by decreasing β-catenin expression after IF. In summary, we validated that ER-induced USP18 exerts a suppressive function in IS damage through SKP2-mediated β-catenin ubiquitination."

      "SUMMARY": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) persist as the primary cause of death worldwide, accounting for roughly 17.9 million fatalities each year. The prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (key risk factors for CVD) continues to escalate at an alarming rate, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies to address this global health crisis. Nutritional ketosis, induced through ketogenic diets, modified fasting, intermittent fasting, and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil consumption, has garnered attention for its potential cardioprotective effects. Ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body, due to a significantly reduced intake of carbohydrates, shifts its primary energy source from glucose to ketone bodies, i.e., beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate, and acetone, which are produced in the liver from fatty acids. This review examines the mechanisms by which ketone bodies, particularly BHB, mitigate cardiovascular risk. We focus mainly on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of BHB and summarize recent evidence to highlight the clinical relevance of ketosis in cardiometabolic health."

      "BACKGROUND": "Managing glycemia during Ramadan is challenging for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) due to prolonged fasting and altered eating patterns. While many are exempt from fasting, some choose to fast, necessitating careful monitoring. The glycemia risk index (GRI) is valuable for assessing glycemic quality and interpreting continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to identify individuals needing closer clinical attention. This study investigates the effects of Ramadan fasting on glycemic control in T1D, focusing on GRI and its components for hypoglycemia (CHypo) and hyperglycemia (CHyper).",
      "METHOD": "An ambispective study involved 186 individuals with T1D using intermittent scanning CGM (isCGM). Data were retrospectively collected for one month before Ramadan and prospectively during and one month after Ramadan. Clinical, metabolic, and glycemic data were collected, with GRI calculated alongside its components.",
      "RESULTS": "During Ramadan, GRI improved by 54.6% (from 56.4 to 25.6), CHypo decreased by 60% (from 6 to 2.4), and CHyper dropped by 40.5% (from 21 to 12.5). However, these benefits were temporary, as glycemic measures increased after Ramadan, reflecting a return to pre-Ramadan patterns once normal routines resumed. No participants were admitted for diabetes emergencies during Ramadan. Adolescents and patients on insulin pumps had more favorable outcomes. GRI and its components significantly correlated with other CGM metrics, with these relationships maintained during and after Ramadan.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Ramadan fasting significantly improved GRI and its components in individuals with T1D. Incorporating GRI as a novel metric alongside classical CGM metrics could enhance glycemic control, highlighting the need for personalized diabetes management strategies."

    "title": "Impact of daily fasting duration on body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors during a time-restricted eating protocol: a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary regimen that limits food intake for at least 12 h daily. Unlike other fasting protocols, TRE does not dictate what or how much to eat but rather focuses on the timing of meals. This approach has been previously demonstrated to improve body composition in individuals with obesity or metabolic impairments. However, its impact on body composition and cardiometabolic factors in healthy individuals remains unclear. Furthermore, the optimal fasting duration is still debated. Thus, we aimed to compare the effects of 8 weeks of different fasting durations on body composition and biochemical parameters in metabolically healthy, non-trained individuals using a parallel randomized controlled trial.",
      "METHODS": "Forty-one volunteers were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups: TRE 16:8 (16 h of fasting,8 h of eating), TRE 14:10 (14 h of fasting,10 h of eating), TRE 12:12 (12 h of fasting,12 h of eating) or a normal diet group (ND; no dietary restriction). Participants underwent body composition measurements and blood tests for lipid profiles (i.e., total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides), fasting glucose, leptin, and anabolic hormones (i.e., insulin and testosterone) levels. Data were analyzed using both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis to account for compliance. A two-way ANOVA for repeated measures was employed to assess interactions between time and group.",
      "RESULTS": "In the ITT analysis, TRE 16:8 reduced body mass (-2.46%, p = 0.003) and absolute fat mass (-8.65%, p = 0.001) with no changes in lean soft tissue and in calorie intake. These results were consistent with the PP analysis which included 8 participants in TRE 16:8, 5 in TRE 14:10, 9 in TRE 12:12, and the entire ND group. Participants in the TRE 16:8 group spontaneously reduced their total caloric intake, although this reduction was not statistically significant. None of the other measurements significantly changed after 8 weeks.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Our results suggest that a 16-hour fasting window, even without caloric restriction, may be a viable strategy for improving body composition in healthy and non-trained individuals, whereas a shorter fasting period may be insufficient to produce significant changes in a healthy population.",

    "abstract": {
      "INTRODUCTION": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a disorder that arises following the selective autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. Beta-cell protective or beta-cell regenerative approaches have gained wider attention, and pharmacological approaches to protect the patient's own insulin-producing beta-cell mass have been proposed. Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker that has been reported to effectively lowers beta-cell thioredoxin-interacting protein expression in rodent beta cells and islets, as well as in human islets, and thus promotes functional beta-cell mass.",
      "METHODS AND ANALYSIS": "The trial is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in participants with T1DM, investigating the effect of verapamil on preservation of beta-cell function (Ver-A-T1D). A total of 120 participants will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio between 360 mg verapamil and placebo, administered orally once daily. T1DM patients aged ≥18 and <45 years will be eligible for recruitment within 6 weeks of diagnosis (defined as day of starting insulin therapy). The primary objective will be to determine the changes in stimulated C-peptide response during the first 2 hours of a mixed meal tolerance test at baseline and after 12 months for 360 mg verapamil administered orally once daily versus placebo. Secondary objectives include the effects of 360 mg verapamil on (1) fasting C-peptide, (2) dried blood spot C-peptide, (3) glycated haemoglobin, (4) daily total insulin dose, (5) time in range by intermittent continuous glucose monitoring measures, (6) other biomarkers related to immunological changes and beta-cell death and (6) safety (vital signs, ECG).",
      "ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION": "Ethics approval was sought from the research ethics committee of all participating countries. All participants provided written informed consent before joining the study. Ver-A-T1D received first regulatory and ethical approvals in Austria. The publication policy is set in the innovative approach towards understanding and arresting type 1 diabetes grant agreement (www.innodia.eu).",

      "RESULTS": "There was no significant difference in the mean percentage change in BMI at the end of the study period (p = 0.55). The IF group exhibited a negative median change (-4.41%) in systolic blood pressure compared with the other two groups (p = 0.014), with no difference among the groups in diastolic blood pressure or blood sugar levels (p > 0.05). The percentage change in waist circumference was more significant in the IF group than in the control group, with a significant improvement in the median percentage change in total cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride, and HDL levels (p < 0.05) as well as in the memory score (p < 0.05).",

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Dysregulated energy metabolism is a hallmark of aging, including brain aging; thus, strategies to restore normal metabolic regulation are at the forefront of aging research. Intermittent fasting, particularly time-restricted eating (TRE), is one of these strategies. Despite its well-established effectiveness in improving metabolic outcomes in older adults, the effect of TRE on preserving or improving cerebrovascular health during aging remains underexplored. We explored how aging itself affects energy metabolism and contextualized these age-related changes to cerebrovascular health. We also conducted a literature search on PubMed and Scopus to identify and summarize current studies on TRE in older adults. Finally, we provided preliminary data from our proof-of-concept pilot trial on the effect of 6-month TRE on cerebrovascular health in older adults. Current evidence shows the potential of TRE to improve energy metabolism and physiological outcomes in older adults. TRE may improve cerebrovascular function indirectly due to its effect on glucose homeostasis. However, to date, direct evidence of the effect of TRE on cerebrovascular parameters is lacking. TRE is a well-tolerated and promising dietary intervention for promoting and maintaining cerebrovascular health in older adults. Further studies on TRE in older adults must be better controlled for energy balance to elucidate its independent effects from those of caloric restriction."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Dietary restriction (DR) has multiple beneficial effects on health and longevity and can also improve the efficacy of certain therapies. Diets used to instigate DR are diverse and the corresponding response is not uniformly measured. We compared the systemic and liver-specific transcriptional response to intermittent fasting (IF) and commercially available fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) after short- and long-term use in C57BL/6 J mice.",
      "RESULTS": "We show that neither DR regimen causes observable adverse effects in mice. The weight loss was limited to 20% and was quickly compensated during refeeding days. The slightly higher weight loss upon FMD versus IF correlated with stronger fasting response assessed by lower glucose levels and higher ketone body, free fatty acids and especially FGF21 concentrations in blood. RNA sequencing demonstrated similar transcriptional programs in the liver after both regimens, with PPARα signalling as top enriched pathway, while on individual gene level FMD more potently increased gluconeogenesis-related, and PPARα and p53 target gene expression compared to IF. Repeated IF induced similar transcriptional responses as acute IF. However, repeated cycles of FMD resulted in blunted expression of genes involved in ketogenesis and fatty acid oxidation.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Short-term FMD causes more pronounced changes in blood parameters and slightly higher weight loss than IF, while both activate similar pathways (particularly PPARα signalling) in the liver. On individual gene level FMD induces a stronger transcriptional response, whereas cyclic application blunts transcriptional upregulation of fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis only in FMD. Hence, our comparative characterization of IF and FMD protocols renders both as effective DR regimens and serves as resource in the fasting research field."

      "SUMMARY": "Diabetes mellitus significantly affects survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma undergoing nephrectomy, requiring personalized care. This case involved a 64-year-old man with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who underwent radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. He consented to a 1-year intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI), including a vegan diet (to lower calorie intake, reduce uric acid, support renal health, and promote weight loss), intermittent fasting, regular exercise, psychological support, and medical management. Quarterly biochemical assessments and monthly adherence evaluations were conducted. Post intervention, the patient achieved diabetes remission, maintaining glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) below 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (reference range, <6.5%; <48 mmol/mol) without medication. He lost 36 kg (79.37 lb), reducing his body mass index from 35.3 to 25.1. His lipid profile normalized (total cholesterol, 175 to 127 mg/dL (4.53 to 3.29 mmol/L) (reference range, <200 mg/dL; <5.18 mmol/L); triglycerides, 155 to 73 mg/dL (1.75 to 0.82 mmol/L) (reference range, <150 mg/dL; <1.69 mmol/L), allowing the discontinuation of statins. Improvements in serum creatinine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were also observed. The patient exhibited normal glucose tolerance, consecutively passing an oral glucose tolerance test for 2 years. This case highlights the potential of lifestyle modifications in managing T2D in patients with a history of nephrectomy."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Chemotherapy is a therapy of choice for many cancers. However, it is often inefficient for long-term patient survival and is usually accompanied by multiple adverse effects. The adverse effects are mainly associated with toxicity to normal cells, frequently resulting in immune system depression, nausea, loss of appetite and metabolic changes. In this respect, the combination of chemotherapy with cannabinoids, especially non-psychoactive, such as cannabidiol, cannabinol and other minor cannabinoids, as well as terpenes, may become very useful. This is especially pertinent because the mechanisms of anticancer effects of cannabinoids on cancer cells are often different from conventional chemotherapeutics. In addition, cannabinoids help alleviate chemotherapy-induced adverse effects, regulate sleep and appetite, and are shown to have analgesic properties. Another component for achieving potential anti-cancer synergism is regulating nutrient availability and metabolism by calorie restriction and intermittent fasting in cancer cells. As tumours require a lot of energy to grow and because glucose is constantly available, malignant cells often opt to use glucose as a primary source of ATP production through substrate-level phosphorylation (fermentation) rather than through oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, periodic depletion of cancer cells of primary fuel, glucose, could result in a strong synergy in killing cancer cells by chemo- and possibly radiotherapy when combined with cannabinoids. This commentary will discuss what is known about such combinatorial treatments, including potential mechanisms and future protocols."

      "OBJECTIVE": "To investigate the effects of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and reoxygenation on insulin resistance (IR) and expressions of miR-27a-3p/PPARγ/IRS1/PI3K/AKT in rat skeletal muscle.",
      "METHODS": "GEO database was used for screening the differentially expressed miRNAs in CIH, and their target genes were subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment analysis followed by construction of the miRNA-mRNA-pathway regulatory network using Cytoscape. In the animal experiment, 48 male SD rats were randomly divided into normoxia group and CIH group (8 weeks of CIH followed by 4 weeks of normoxic recovery). Blood and skeletal muscle samples were collected at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks to evaluate the changes in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting insulin (FINS) levels and muscular pathology. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to detect the changes in the expressions of miR-27a-3p, PPARγ, GLUT4, IRS1, p-IRS1, PI3K, p-AKT and AKT in the muscular tissues.",
      "RESULTS": "No muscular miRNA datasets for CIH were available in GEO database, from which only a kidney-related dataset (GSE202480) was obtained, based on which a total of 165 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. GO/KEGG analysis suggested that these miRNAs were involved in muscular regulation and insulin signaling. The miRNA-mRNA-pathway network highlighted miR-27a-3p as a crucial regulator in the PPAR and PI3K/AKT pathway. In the animal experiment, the rats subjected to CIH for 8 weeks showed significantly increased FBG, FINS, HOMA-IR, and PPARγ levels, loose muscle fiber arrangement, decreased cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers, and lowered expressions of miR-27a-3p, p-IRS1/IRS1, PI3K, and p-AKT/AKT in the skeletal muscles.",

      "INTERVENTION": "Participants fasted daily from 7 p.m. to 3 p.m. in the 4 h TRE group (20 h) and from 7 p.m. to 1 p.m. in the 6 h TRE group (18 h), followed by ad libitum eating for the remainder of the day. Controls received no dietary recommendations.",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES": "IGF1, IGFBPs, hsCRP, and adipokines were the main outcome measures of this analysis.",
      "STATISTICAL ANALYSIS": "Repeated measures ANOVA and mediation analysis were conducted.",
      "RESULTS": "Body weight significantly decreased with TRE (-3.6 ± 0.3%), contrasting with controls (+0.2 ± 0.5%, ",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Eight-week daily 4 to 6 h TRE did not affect IGF1, IGFBP1, or IGFBP3 levels but improved insulin, HOMA-IR, and 8-isoprostane. IGFBP2 increased and leptin decreased when weight loss exceeded 3.5% of baseline."

      "RESULTS": "The mean reduction in LFC was -20.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): -25.0, -15.9%] in the ICR group and -15.5% (95% CI: -20.3, -10.8%) in the CCR group. Changes in LFC were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 0.15), and were homogeneous among different liver segments. The analysis of exploratory endpoints provided clues that the ICR was associated with greater reductions in fat mass and glycosylated hemoglobin. There were no significant differences in changes of weight, lean mass, insulin resistance, triglyceride, and liver stiffness between the 2 groups. Participants showed high adherence to both the ICR and CCR schemes.",

      "BACKGROUND": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an effective energy restricted dietary strategy to reduce body and fat mass and improve metabolic health in individuals with either an overweight or obese status. However, dietary energy restriction may impair muscle protein synthesis (MPS) resulting in a concomitant decline in lean body mass. Due to periods of prolonged fasting combined with irregular meal intake, we hypothesised that IF would reduce rates of MPS compared to an energy balanced diet with regular meal patterns.",
      "AIMS": "We assessed the impact of a short-term, ten days, alternate day fasting or a continuous energy restricted diet to a control diet on integrated rates of skeletal MPS in middle-aged males with overweight or obesity.",
      "METHODS": "Twenty-seven middle-aged males with overweight or obesity (age: 44.6 ± 5.4 y; BMI: 30.3 ± 2.6 kg/m",

The reductions in body mass were greater in ADF and CER compared to CON (P < 0.001). Lean and fat mass were decreased by a similar magnitude across groups (main time effect, P < 0.001; main group effect, P > 0.05). Fasting plasma leptin concentrations decreased in ADF and CER (P < 0.001), with no differences in fasting plasma glucose or insulin concentrations between groups.",

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Time-restricted feeding is known to ameliorate obesity in young mice. However, evaluation of its effect in old age is still lacking. The current work aims to investigate the effects of time-restricted feeding on treating pre-existing obesity in old animals. The study utilized middle-aged and old high fat diet-induced obese mice and subjected them to 8 h daily time-restricted feeding. Aged obese mice did not lose fat mass but lost lean mass after 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, time-restricted feeding reduced adiposity in brown adipose tissue, reversed excessive hepatic lipid accumulation, and improved glucose homeostasis in middle-aged and old obese mice. Mechanistic studies show that these metabolic benefits were mediated by transcriptional downregulation of essential genes responsible for hepatic adipogenesis and adipose tissue chronic inflammation. These results demonstrate that time-restricted feeding improves metabolic health and has beneficial effects in combating diet-induced obesity in aged obese mice. KEY POINTS: Contrary to in young obese mice, in old obese mice time-restricted feeding did not significantly reduce body fat but decreased lean mass. Time-restricted feeding reduced adipose tissue inflammation, reversed fatty liver, and improved glucose homeostasis in aged mice with diet-induced obesity. Time-restricted feeding is effective in improving metabolic homeostasis in aged mice, but less effective in terms of reducing obesity. Future studies should investigate the underlying mechanism of how ageing impaired intermittent fasting induced fat loss."

    "title": "From starvation to time-restricted eating: a review of fasting physiology.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "We have long known that subjects with obesity who fast for several weeks survive. Calculations that assume the brain can only use glucose indicated that all carbohydrate and protein sources would be consumed by the brain within several weeks yet subjects with obesity who fasted for several weeks survived. This anomaly led to the determination of the metabolic role of ketone bodies. Subsequent studies transformed our understanding of ketone bodies and illustrated the value of challenging the norm and adapting theory to evidence. Although prolonged fasting is no longer a treatment for obesity, the early studies of starvation provided valuable insights about macronutrient metabolism and ketone body adaptations that fasting elicits. Intermittent fasting and its variants such as time-restricted eating are fasting models that are far less regimented than starvation and severe calorie restriction; yet they produce metabolic benefits. The mechanisms that produce the metabolic changes that intermittent fasting elicits are relatively unknown. In this article, we review the physiology of starvation, starvation adaptation diets, diet-induced ketosis, and intermittent fasting. Understanding the premise and physiology that these regimens induce is necessary to draw parallels and provoke thoughts on the mechanisms underlying the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting and its variants."

      "BACKGROUND": "Randomized controlled trials have confirmed the effectiveness of four prevalent caloric restriction regimens in reducing obesity-related health risks. However, there is no consensus on the optimal regimen for weight management in adults.",
      "METHODS": "We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to January 15, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving adults, evaluating the weight-loss effects of alternate day fasting (ADF), short-term fasting (STF), time-restricted eating (TRE), and continuous energy restriction (CER). The primary outcome was body weight, with secondary outcomes including BMI, fat mass, lean mass, waist circumference, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and adverse events. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted, ranking regimens using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve and the probability of being the best. Study quality was assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis tool.",
      "RESULTS": "Data from 47 RCTs (representing 3363 participants) were included. ADF showed the most significant body weight loss (Mean difference (MD): -3.42; 95% Confidence interval (CI): -4.28 to -2.55), followed by TRE (MD: -2.25; 95% CI: -2.92 to -1.59). STF (MD: -1.87; 95% CI: -3.32 to -0.56) and CER (MD: -1.59; 95% CI: -2.42 to -0.79) rank third and fourth, respectively. STF lead to decline in lean mass (MD: -1.26; 95% CI: -2.16, -0.47). TRE showed benefits on fasting glucose (MD: -2.98; 95% CI: -4.7, -1.26). Subgroup analysis revealed all four caloric restriction regimens likely lead to modest weight loss after 1-3 months, with ADF ranked highest, but by 4-6 months, varying degrees of weight regain occur, particularly with CER, while interventions lasting 7-12 months may result in effective weight loss, with TRE potentially ranking first during both the 4-6 months and 7-12 months periods. ADF showing fewer and shorter-lasting physical symptoms.",
      "CONCLUSION": "All four included regiments were effective in reducing body weight, with ADF likely having the most significant impact. Each regimen likely leads to modest weight loss after 1-3 months, followed by weight regain by 4-6 months. However, interventions lasting 7-12 months achieve greater weight loss overall.",

      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an increasingly popular dietary approach involving alternating fasting and eating periods. This review aims to summarize the growing body of literature demonstrating that IF is a potential nutritional practice that involves alternating periods of fasting and eating and the numerous benefits of IF, especially in the modulation of healthy gut microbiota. The positive impact of intermittent fasting on gut microbiota not only promotes gastrointestinal health but also has far-reaching effects on critical systems throughout the body. Additionally, the evidence presented in this review highlights the significant preventive and therapeutic effects of intermittent fasting on a wide range of disorders. This includes reducing the risk of diabetes, and neurological disorders, alleviating obesity, and enhancing the functioning of the liver, ultimately contributing to the maintenance of metabolic equilibrium. Perhaps most notably, these effects play a substantial role in preventing diabetes, a global health concern of increasing significance. This comprehensive investigation delves into the scientific foundations of intermittent fasting's impact on gut microbiota and its implications for averting chronic diseases, providing valuable insights for future research and therapeutic applications."

We aimed to characterize the effects of intermittently restricted feeding on energy balance and glucose tolerance in female mice.",
      "METHODS": "Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet and intermittently food restricted to 60% of control littermates' ad libitum intake, starting at weaning and until week 19. Restricted mice were subsequently allowed ad libitum access to the same diet. Body composition and energy balance were measured at weeks 18.5, 19, 30, and 40. At week 42, mice underwent an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and plasma appetitive hormones measurements after nutrient gavage.",
      "RESULTS": "During the food restriction phase, restricted mice accrued lower weight and fat mass than controls despite periodic ad libitum food access. Reintroduction of continuous ad libitum food caused increased food intake during the light phase and increased body mass in restricted mice. Minor differences in body composition-adjusted energy expenditure between groups were observed at week 40. At week 42, glucose tolerance was impaired in restricted mice compared to controls, and trends toward lower levels of postprandial anorexigenic hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and pancreatic polypeptide were observed.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Our findings suggest that repeated intermittent food restriction leads to changes in eating behavior that predispose to glucose intolerance when food is freely available. Future studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying these changes."

      "SUMMARY": "Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development and enlargement of multiple kidney cysts, leading to progressive kidney function decline. To date, Tolvaptan, the only approved treatment for this condition, is able to slow down the loss of annual kidney function without stopping the progression of the disease. Furthermore, this therapy is approved only for patients with rapid disease progression and its compliance is problematic because of the drug's impact on quality of life. The recent literature suggests that cystic cells are subject to several metabolic dysregulations, particularly in the glucose pathway, and mitochondrial abnormalities, leading to decreased oxidative phosphorylation and impaired fatty acid oxidation. This finding paved the way for new lines of research targeting potential therapeutic interventions for ADPKD. In particular, this review highlights the latest studies on the use of ketosis, through ketogenic dietary interventions (daily calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, ketogenic diets, and exogenous ketosis), as a potential strategy for patients with ADPKD, and the possible involvement of microbiota in the ketogenic interventions' effect."

However, RIF but not 16IF also generates marked beneficial effects in terms of reduced subcutaneous fat and liver steatosis.

Most of the reviewed studies reported intermittent fasting and patient education as effective self-management interventions for GD in Africa. The barriers identified in the reviewed studies were either patient-related or facility-related. Patient-related barriers included lack of awareness, and negative attitude, while facility-related barriers included lack of access to education on GD, especially, face-to-face educational interventions.",

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Numerous observational studies have suggested a potential causal relationship between skipping breakfast and cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure (HF). However, these studies are susceptible to inherent confounders and the challenge of reverse causation, and the underlying metabolic factors are not yet clear. Therefore, our aim is to assess the causal impact of breakfast skipping on HF and the role of potential mediating metabolic products from a genetic perspective, by conducting Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies and mediation analysis. We leveraged summary data from the most extensive genome-wide association studies to date on breakfast skipping (with 193,860 participants), blood metabolites (with 118,461 participants), and HF (involving 47,309 cases and 930,014 controls). To explore the causal relationship between breakfast skipping and HF, as well as the role of 249 potential blood metabolite mediators, we conducted bidirectional MR and mediation MR analyses. We primarily employed the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method, complemented by various other techniques to ensure the comprehensiveness and reliability of our analysis. Our research confirms a causal association between breakfast skipping and an increased risk of HF (odds ratio [OR]: 1.378, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.047-1.813; p = 0.022). Furthermore, our research findings demonstrate that breakfast skipping is positively correlated with 6 blood metabolites and negatively correlated with 2 others. Notably, our mediation MR analysis further reveals that three blood metabolites act as mediators in the relationship between breakfast skipping and the risk of HF. Specifically, the mediating effects are attributed to the ratio of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to total fatty acids (proportion mediated = 9.41%, 95% CI: 2.10-28.61%), glucose (proportion mediated = 6.17%, 95% CI: 0.97-28.53%), and glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) (proportion mediated = 5.68%, 95% CI: 0.94-21.62%). The combined mediating effects of these three factors total 20.53% (95%CI: 8.59-91.06%). Our research confirms the causal relationship between genetically instrumented breakfast skipping and HF, underscoring the potential mediating roles played by three key blood metabolites: ratio of DHA to total fatty acids, glucose and GlycA. This discovery offers valuable perspectives for clinical strategies targeting HF."

      "SUMMARY": "Poor maternal diet and psychosocial stress represent two environmental factors that can significantly impact maternal health during pregnancy. While various mouse models have been developed to study the relationship between maternal and offspring health and behaviour, few incorporate multiple sources of stress that mirror the complexity of human experiences. Maternal high-fat diet (HF) models in rodents are well-established, whereas use of psychosocial stress interventions in female mice are still emerging. The social instability stress (SIS) paradigm, serves as a chronic and unpredictable form of social stress. To evaluate the combined effects of a poor maternal diet and intermittent social stress on maternal health and behaviour, we developed a novel maternal stress model using adult female C57Bl/6 mice. We observed that all HF+ mice demonstrated rapid weight gain, elevated fasting blood glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance independent of the presence (+) or absence (-) of SIS. Behavioural testing output revealed anxiety-like behaviours remained similar across all groups prior to pregnancy. However, integrated anxiety z-scores revealed a mixed anxious profile amongst HF+/SIS+ females prior to pregnancy. HF+/SIS+ females also did not show reduced plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels that were observed in our other HF+ and HF- stress groups after SIS exposure. Further, HF+/SIS+ females demonstrated significant postpartum maternal neglect, resulting in fewer numbers of live offspring. These findings suggest that prolonged maternal HF diet consumption, coupled with previous exposure to SIS, places a significant burden on the maternal stress response system, resulting in reduced parental investment and negative postpartum behaviour towards offspring."

    "title": "Time-Restricted Feeding Reduces Atherosclerosis in LDLR KO Mice but Not in ApoE Knockout Mice.",
    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Dyslipidemia increases cardiovascular disease risk, the leading cause of death worldwide. Under time-restricted feeding (TRF), wherein food intake is restricted to a consistent window of <12 hours, weight gain, glucose intolerance, inflammation, dyslipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia are all reduced in mice fed an obesogenic diet. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) mutations are a major cause of familial hypercholesterolemia and early-onset cardiovascular disease.",
      "METHODS": "We subjected benchmark preclinical models, mice lacking LDLR-knockout or ApoE knockout to ad libitum feeding of an isocaloric atherogenic diet either ad libitum or 9 hours TRF for up to 13 weeks and assessed disease development, mechanism, and global changes in hepatic gene expression and plasma lipids. In a regression model, a subset of LDLR-knockout mice were ad libitum fed and then subject to TRF.",
      "RESULTS": "TRF could significantly attenuate weight gain, hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis in mice lacking the LDLR-knockout mice under experimental conditions of both prevention and regression. In LDLR-knockout mice, increased hepatic expression of genes mediating β-oxidation during fasting is associated with reduced VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) secretion and lipid accumulation. Additionally, increased sterol catabolism coupled with fecal loss of cholesterol and bile acids contributes to the atheroprotective effect of TRF. Finally, TRF alone or combined with a cholesterol-free diet can reduce atherosclerosis in LDLR-knockout mice. However, mice lacking ApoE, which is an important protein for hepatic lipoprotein reuptake do not respond to TRF.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "In a preclinical animal model, TRF is effective in both the prevention and regression of atherosclerosis in LDLR knockout mice. The results suggest TRF alone or in combination with a low-cholesterol diet can be a lifestyle intervention for reducing cardiovascular disease risk in humans."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "The aim of this work was to test whether we can treat cholestasis with dietary approaches applied after the onset of the disease. The effects of intermittent fasting and dietary restriction on liver damage caused by common bile duct ligation (BDL) in rats were studied, with particular attention paid to changes in the activity of enzymes of energy metabolism and antioxidant protection. Morphological changes in liver tissue and serum markers of liver damage were assessed in rats with BDL kept for one month on ad libitum diet, intermittent fasting, or 35% dietary restriction. We studied parameters of glucose metabolism (activity of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis enzymes), TCA cycle, and indicators of oxidative stress and redox status of the liver tissue. Dietary restriction resulted in an increase in gluconeogenesis activity, antioxidant capacity, and autophagy activation. When implemented after BDL, none of the dietary restriction protocols reduced the level of oxidative stress, detrimental morphological and biochemical alterations, or the fibrosis progression. Thus, under severe damage and oxidative stress developing in cholestasis, dietary restrictions are not hepatoprotective and can only be used in a pre-treatment mode."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "This article offers a systematic literature review (SLR) on the use of the MiniMed 780G automated insulin delivery system (MM780G) in people with type 1 diabetes (PwT1D) during Ramadan intermittent fasting. It also presents consensus recommendations on the use of MM780G during the Ramadan period. The SLR was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. The recommendations resulted from a consensus-forming process involving a panel of experts. The process considered evidence found in the SLR as well as the expert opinions. In total, six studies were included in the SLR. The evidence and expert opinions led to recommendations related to (a) pre-Ramadan counseling of MM780G users who plan to fast; (b) suggested MM780G settings, meal announcement strategy, and safety aspects during Ramadan (including a contingency plan); and (c) post-Ramadan transition into and out of Eid-al-Fitr festivities. The SLR findings showed that the MM780G maintains glycemic control at target in PwT1D during Ramadan (meeting continuous glucose monitoring-based clinical targets proposed by the International Consensus on Time-in-Range) while ensuring low rates of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Automated insulin delivery also helps PwT1D fast more days of Ramadan compared with users of other less advanced modalities of treatment. Pre-Ramadan guidance on specific aspects of the MM780G along with the International Diabetes Federation and Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance counseling guidelines is recommended. There is still a challenge with post-Iftar hyperglycemia, which could potentially be mitigated by following the recommendations outlined in this article."

      "BACKGROUND": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) has been shown to be associated with improvements in some aspects of the metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, only a few studies have addressed the effect of TRE on pulse wave velocity (PWV). We thus propose a randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of TRE with standard dietary advice on PWV and thereby present the protocol.",
      "METHODS": "Forty-eight participants will be assigned to either TRE or control groups using simple randomization. The TRE group will consume their meals during a 10-h period and experience 14 h of fasting. They will also be advised to consume their last meal no later than 20:00. Both groups will receive standard dietary advice. The participants will be followed for 6 weeks. The primary outcome will be changes in PWV. Laboratory measurements, including lipid profile, liver enzyme tests, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin concentrations, and insulin resistance, as well as anthropometric data, blood pressure, basal metabolic rate, appetite status, physical activity level, sleep quality, cognitive function, quality of life, and calorie intake, will be evaluated throughout the study.",

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obesity is associated with one-fifth of cancer deaths, and breast cancer is one of the obesity-related cancers. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, leading to the absence of these therapeutic targets, followed by poor overall survival. We investigated if obesity could hasten TNBC progression and intermittent fasting (IF) could attenuate the progression of obesity-related TNBC. Our meta-analysis of the TNBC outcomes literature showed that obesity led to poorer overall survival in TNBC patients. Fasting-mimicking media reduced cell proliferation disrupted the cell cycle, and decreased cell migration and invasion. IF decreased body weight in obese mice but no change in normal mice. Obese mice exhibited elevated plasma glucose and cholesterol levels, increased tumor volume and weight, and enhanced macrophage accumulation in tumors. The obesity-exacerbated TNBC progression was attenuated after IF, which decreased cyclin B1 and vimentin levels and reduced the proinflammatory signature in the obesity-associated tumor microenvironment. IF attenuated obesity-induced TNBC progression through reduced obesity and tumor burdens in cell and animal experiments, supporting the potential of a cost-effective adjuvant IF therapy for TNBC through lifestyle change. Further evidence is needed of these IF benefits in TNBC, including from human clinical trials."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "There is a growing consensus that fasting-induced ketosis has beneficial effects on human physiology. Despite these compelling benefits, fasting-induced ketosis raises concerns in some clinicians because it is often inappropriately compared with the pathologic uncontrolled ketone production in diabetic ketoacidosis. The determinants of the inter-individual differences in the intensity of ketosis during long-term fasting is unknown.",
      "METHODS": "We monitored daily variations in fasting ketonemia, as well as ketonuria, which is less invasive, in a large cohort of 1610 subjects, fasting between 4 and 21 days with the Buchinger Wilhelmi program, minimally supplemented with ~75-250 kcal (daily fruit juice, vegetable soup, and honey).",
      "RESULTS": "Ketonuria was detected in more than 95% of fasting subjects from day 4 onwards. Subjects consuming only soups, without fruit juice or honey, exhibited reduced caloric intake (72 kcal instead of 236 kcal) and carbohydrate intake (15.6 g instead of 56.5 g), leading to more intense ketonuria. Participants with high ketonuria were, in the majority, males, young, had a higher body weight, and had lower HDL-C and urea values. They had a larger decrease in blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin levels, body weight, and waist circumference. Furthermore, in the high-ketonuria group, a larger increase in blood uric acid concentration was observed.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Our study showed that long-term fasting triggered ketosis, never reaching pathological levels, and that ketosis is influenced by age, gender, health, and the level of physical activity. Furthermore, it is modulated but not suppressed by minimal carbohydrate intake. Our study paves the way for better understanding how supplementation can modulate the therapeutic effects and tolerability of long-term fasting."

      "SCOPE": "Grifola frondosa has been shown to induce immune modulatory, modulate autophagy, and apoptosis in cancer cells. However, little is known about its potential for managing tumor progression as an adjunct to nutrient restriction.",
      "METHODS AND RESULTS": "Water extract produces a G. frondosa polysaccharide-protein complex (G. frondosa PPC) of average molecular weight of 46.48 kDa, with glucose (54.8%) as the main constituent. Under serum-restricted conditions, G. frondosa PPC can significantly inhibit MC38 colorectal tumor cell migration in vitro. Under alternate-day fasting condition, G. frondosa PPC can only significantly inhibit the growth of subcutaneous (s.c.) tumor, but is feeble in halting its spread in the intraperitoneal (i.p.) cavity in tumor-bearing mice. Histopathological examination and Raman imaging show a significant increase in lipid content in the tumor microenvironment (TME) tissue of the s.c. tumor-bearing mice. G. frondosa PPC significantly increases C17:0 and C24:0 saturated fatty acids and significantly decreases C16:1 and C18:1 monounsaturated fatty acids in the TME of s.c. tumor-bearing mice compared with the i.p. cavity model.",

      "SUMMARY": "This research aims to investigate the effects of plasma from 12-month-old intermittently fasting rats (IFpls) and untreated rats (Npls) on the liver biomolecules and histological changes in 24-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Fasting rats underwent an 18-h daily fasting period and a 6-h feeding window for 35 days. The plasma was administered bi-daily, and blood samples were examined for specific liver biomolecules. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to identify molecular profiles. Liver sections were stained for histopathological evaluation, and the expression levels of Notch signalling pathway components were assessed. Distinct molecular profiles were identified across liver biomolecules, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids with high accuracy. Notably, IFpls was found to protect against hepatic instability, microvesicular steatosis and liver fibrosis by decreasing lymphatic infiltration density and Notch pathway expression levels. Both treatments reduced protein oxidation and carbonylation, with Npls showing a pronounced decrease in protein oxidation. Furthermore, Npls increased protein conformation and glycogen/phosphate content, while IFpls increased glucose/protein content. Both IFpls and Npls induce substantial and unique alterations in liver biomolecules. IFpls offers a protective effect on various liver conditions, while Npls exhibits promising results in reducing protein oxidation and altering biomolecule content. These findings offer valuable insights for future research and potential therapeutic approaches."

This study aims to explore the intricate relationship between meal-skipping patterns and hyperglycemia risk across distinct age groups in South Korean adults.",
      "METHODS": "Utilizing data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) conducted from 2013 to 2020, comprising 28,530 individuals aged 19 years and older, this study employed multivariable logistic regression models to examine the associations between meal-skipping patterns and the risk of hyperglycemia.",
      "RESULTS": "Meal-skipping patterns were categorized into three groups: no skipping (NS), skipping breakfast (SB), and skipping dinner (SD). Age groups were defined as \"young\" (aged 19-44), \"middle-aged\" (aged 45-64), and \"elderly\" adults (over 65 years old). Among \"young\" adults, SB was associated with a 1.33-fold higher risk of hyperglycemia (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.14-1.54) compared to NS. Conversely, in \"elderly\" adults, SD was linked to a 0.49-fold reduced risk (95% CI = 0.29-0.82) when compared to NS. Additionally, we observed that the Korean Health Eating Index (KHEI) scores, representing the quality of diet on a scale of 0 to 100, were consistently lower in SB compared to NS across all age groups. Intriguingly, specifically among the \"elderly\" group, this score was higher in SD compared to NS (p < 0.001).",

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF), characterized by alternating periods of fasting and unrestricted eating, typically within an 8-hour window or less each day, has gained significant attention as a possible dietary approach. While it is recognized for its metabolic advantages, like weight loss and enhanced glucose and insulin sensitivity, its effect on cardiovascular health remains a topic of mixed opinions. Recent findings suggest a potential downside, with reports indicating a concerning association: a 91 % higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality compared to eating spread across a 12- to 16-hour period. Despite this alarming statistic, the evidence cannot establish a causal link. The impact of IF on CVD is still insufficiently understood, with benefits sometimes exaggerated and risks downplayed in popular discourse. This scoping review aims to consolidate the current evidence, addressing unresolved questions about the benefits and risks of IF, particularly its association with CVD risks and mortality. The goal is to provide a balanced perspective on the potential health implications of IF, emphasizing the need for further research to clarify its long-term effects on cardiovascular health."

      "SUMMARY": "Diet may promote brain health in metabolically impaired older individuals. In an 8-week randomized clinical trial involving 40 cognitively intact older adults with insulin resistance, we examined the effects of 5:2 intermittent fasting and the healthy living diet on brain health. Although intermittent fasting induced greater weight loss, the two diets had comparable effects in improving insulin signaling biomarkers in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles, decreasing the brain-age-gap estimate (reflecting the pace of biological aging of the brain) on magnetic resonance imaging, reducing brain glucose on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and improving blood biomarkers of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with minimal changes in cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Intermittent fasting and healthy living improved executive function and memory, with intermittent fasting benefiting more certain cognitive measures. In exploratory analyses, sex, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E and SLC16A7 genotypes modulated diet effects. The study provides a blueprint for assessing brain effects of dietary interventions and motivates further research on intermittent fasting and continuous diets for brain health optimization.

      "OBJECTIVES": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TRE combined with exercise compared with control diet with exercise in improving the body composition and metabolic health of adults.",
      "METHODS": "Five electronic databases were searched for relevant studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect of TRE combined with exercise on body composition and metabolic health in adults were included. All results in the meta-analysis are reported as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation assessment.",
      "RESULTS": "In total, 19 RCTs comprising 568 participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. TRE combined with exercise likely reduced the participants' body mass (MD: -1.86 kg; 95% CI: -2.75, -0.97 kg) and fat mass (MD: -1.52 kg; 95% CI: -2.07, -0.97 kg) when compared with the control diet with exercise. In terms of metabolic health, the TRE combined with exercise group likely reduced triglycerides (MD: -13.38 mg/dL, 95% CI: -21.22, -5.54 mg/dL) and may result in a reduction in low-density lipoprotein (MD: -8.52 mg/dL; 95% CI: -11.72, -5.33 mg/dL) and a large reduction in leptin (MD: -0.67 ng/mL; 95% CI: -1.02, -0.33 ng/mL). However, TRE plus exercise exhibited no additional benefit on the glucose profile, including fasting glucose and insulin, and other lipid profiles, including total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein concentrations, compared with the control group.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Combining TRE with exercise may be more effective in reducing body weight and fat mass and improving lipid profile than control diet with exercise. Implementing this approach may benefit individuals aiming to achieve weight loss and enhance their metabolic well-being. This study was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022353834."

      "SUMMARY": "The digital health field is experiencing substantial growth due to its potential for sustained and longitudinal deployment. In turn, this may drive improved monitoring and intervention as catalysts for behavioral change compared to traditional point-of-care practices. In particular, the increase in incidence of population health challenges such as diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, and other disorders coupled with rising healthcare costs have emphasized the importance of exploring technical, economics, and implementation considerations, among others in the decentralization of health and healthcare innovations. Both healthy individuals and patients stand to benefit from continued technical advances and studies in these domains. To address these points, this study reports a N-of-1 study comprised of sustained regimens of intermittent fasting, fitness (strength and cardiovascular training), and high protein, low carbohydrate diet and parallel monitoring. These regimens were paired with serial blood ketone, blood glucose (wearable and finger stick) and blood pressure readings, as well as body weight measurements using a collection of devices. Collectively this suite of platforms and approaches were used to monitor metabolic switching from glucose to ketones as energy sources-a process associated with potential cardio- and neuroprotective functions. In addition to longitudinal biomarker dynamics, this work discusses user perspectives on the potential role of harnessing digital devices to these dynamics as potential gamification factors, as well as considerations for the role of biomarker monitoring in health regimen development, user stratification, and potentially informing downstream population-scale studies to address metabolic disease, healthy aging and longevity, among other indications."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Sympathetic overactivity caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia is a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea. A high sympathetic tone elicits increases in plasma free fatty acid and insulin. Our objective was to assess the impact of 14 nights of chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure on sympathetic activity, glucose control, lipid profile and subcutaneous fat tissue remodelling in non-obese healthy humans. In this prospective, double-blinded crossover study, 12 healthy subjects were randomized, among them only nine underwent the two phases of exposures of 14 nights chronic intermittent hypoxia versus air. Sympathetic activity was measured by peroneal microneurography (muscle sympathetic nerve activity) before and after each exposure. Fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide and free fatty acid were assessed at rest and during a multisampling oral glucose tolerance test. We assessed histological remodelling, adrenergic receptors, lipolysis and lipogenesis genes expression and functional changes of the adipose tissue. Two weeks of exposure of chronic intermittent hypoxia versus ambient air significantly increased sympathetic activity (p = 0.04). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity increased from 24.5 [18.9; 26.8] before to 21.7 [13.8; 25.7] after ambient air exposure, and from 20.6 [17.4; 23.9] before to 28.0 [24.4; 31.5] bursts per min after exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia. After chronic intermittent hypoxia, post-oral glucose tolerance test circulating free fatty acid area under the curve increased (p = 0.05) and free fatty acid sensitivity to insulin decreased (p = 0.028). In adipocyte tissue, intermittent hypoxia increased expression of lipolysis genes (adipocyte triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase) and lipogenesis genes (fatty acid synthase; p < 0.05). In this unique experimental setting in healthy humans, chronic intermittent hypoxia induced high sympathetic tone, lipolysis and decreased free fatty acid sensitivity to insulin. This might participate in the trajectory to systemic insulin resistance and diabetes for patients with obstructive sleep apnea."

      "BACKGROUND": "This study investigated the association between breakfast skipping and periodontitis and the mediating role of sugar and lipid metabolism and systemic inflammation in this association using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016-2018.",
      "METHODS": "This study included 11,953 participants, representing an estimated 33.9 million people. Complex sample logistic regression was used to assess the independent association between breakfast skipping and periodontitis. Subgroup analysis was conducted with modifiers including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), urban residence, education level, marital status, and diabetes. Structural equation modeling assessed potential mediation by biomarkers related to glucose and lipid metabolism along with systemic inflammation.",
      "RESULTS": "The fully adjusted logistic regression model indicated a positive association between breakfast skipping and periodontitis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.234 (1.026-1.483), p = 0.025). This association was highlighted in middle-aged (40-60 years), female, highly educated, married individuals with BMI < 25 kg/m",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "A new, independent association between breakfast skipping, and periodontitis has been discovered, which is partially mediated by sugar and lipid metabolism, and systemic inflammation. The findings provide new insights into the benefits of chrononutrition for periodontal health."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has proven to be a feasible dietary intervention for the wider population. The recent increase in IF clinical trials highlights its potential effects on health, including changes in body composition, cardiometabolic status, and aging. Although IF may have clinical applications in different populations, studies suggest there may be sex-specific responses in parameters such as body composition or glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, the existing literature on IF clinical trials is summarized, the application of IF in both disease prevention and management is discussed, and potential disparities in response to this type of diet between men and women are assessed. Moreover, the potential mechanisms that may be contributing to the sexually dimorphic response, such as age, body composition, tissue distribution, or sex hormones are investigated. This review underscores the need to further study these sex-specific responses to IF to define the most effective time frames and length of fasting periods for men and women. Tailoring IF to specific populations with a personalized approach may help achieve its full potential as a lifestyle intervention with clinical benefits."

    "title": "A Narrative Review of the Significance of Popular Diets in Diabetes Mellitus Management.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Diabetes mellitus is a collection of metabolic disorders marked by elevated levels of glucose in the blood due to irregularities in the generation or functioning of insulin. Medical nutrition therapy and weight loss are crucial elements in the management of diabetes and the prevention of complications. Several diets have become popular over time for the goal of achieving weight loss, but their popularity has declined due to a lack of reliable scientific evidence. This study classifies popular diets into three categories: diets that manage the composition of macronutrients, diets that restrict specific foods or food groups, and diets that manipulate meal timing. The review includes research studies that investigated the effects of popular diets on the prevention, management, and complications of diabetes. It is clear that different popular diets can have positive effects on both preventing and treating diabetes and preventing and treating complications related to diabetes. However, it is not practical to determine which diet is the most effective option for preventing or controlling diabetes. Thus, the main focus should be on common underlying factors that support well-being, such as decreasing the intake of refined grains and added sugar, choosing non-starchy vegetables, and giving priority to whole foods over processed foods whenever possible, until there is stronger evidence supporting the specific benefits of different dietary patterns."

      "BACKGROUND": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes. Its development is preceded by alterations in the initial phase of carbohydrate metabolism characterized by insulin resistance. This study aims to evaluate the role of intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation characteristic of OSA on the risk of insulin resistance among apneic patients without diabetes.",
      "METHODOLOGY": "92 consecutive patients with OSA without evidence of diabetes were recruited. Overnight video polysomnography was performed and, the following morning, fasting blood glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin were determined. Insulin resistance was measured using the HOMA-IR index.",
      "RESULTS": "Insulin resistance was present in 52.2% of OSA patients. In these subjects, insulin resistance was independently associated to the apnea index during REM sleep (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.16; p = 0.004), desaturation index (aOR 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.13; p = 0.027), and sleep time with oxygen saturation below 90% (aOR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08; p = 0.049). Furthermore, the HOMA-IR level was also directly related to the desaturation index (standardized regression coefficient [B] = 0.514, p < 0.001) and to the apnea index during REM sleep (B = 0.344, p = 0.002).",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Intermittent hypoxia and disturbances in REM sleep emerge as main contributors to insulin resistance in OSA patients yet to experience diabetes onset."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Genomic alterations that activate Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) are common in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. However, the depth and duration of response is often limited. Here, we conduct integrative transcriptomics, metabolomics, and phosphoproteomics analysis of patient-derived models to define pathways downstream of oncogenic FGFR2 signaling that fuel ICC growth and to uncover compensatory mechanisms associated with pathway inhibition. We find that FGFR2-mediated activation of Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) maintains a highly glycolytic phenotype. Conversely, FGFR inhibition blocks glucose uptake and glycolysis while inciting adaptive changes, including switching fuel source utilization favoring fatty acid oxidation and increasing mitochondrial fusion and autophagy. Accordingly, FGFR inhibitor efficacy is potentiated by combined mitochondrial targeting, an effect enhanced in xenograft models by intermittent fasting. Thus, we show that oncogenic FGFR2 signaling drives NF-κB-dependent glycolysis in ICC and that metabolic reprogramming in response to FGFR inhibition confers new targetable vulnerabilities."

      "SUMMARY": "Polyuria is an early sign of diabetic nephropathy (DN) that produces dehydration in diabetic patients. This could be caused by alteration of renal aquaporin 2 (AQP2) expression. This study aimed to describe the relation between autophagy modulation via intermittent fasting (IF) and renal AQP2 expression and polyuria in case of DN. We divided the rats into control, DN and IF groups. After 2 and 4 weeks of diabetes induction, blood glucose (BG), serum creatinine (Scr), urine volume, and 24 hours urine protein (UP) were examined. Diabetic nephropathy histopathological index (DNHI) was calculated to evaluate histopathological changes. Immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR were performed to measure the levels of AQP2 and the autophagy marker; LC3 in kidney tissue. DNHI was correlated to the PCR and immunoexpression of AQP2 and LC3. Intermittent fasting significantly decreased the BG, Scr, urine volume, 24 hours UP, and DNHI as compared diabetes. Diabetes significantly elevated the immunoreactivity and mRNA expression levels of AQP2 and LC3 as compared to the control. However, the IF decreased AQP2 and stimulated autophagy in cyclic fashion. Our data revealed significant positive correlations between AQP2 and LC3 at the level of immunoexpression and mRNA at 2nd weeks. Taken together, these data showed that autophagy stimulation didn't regulate AQP2 expression in case of diabetic nephropathy, however IF decreased polyuria through improvement of glycemic state."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal disorder that leads to ovarian cysts, irregular ovulation, and hormonal swings in women. It is a complex and heterogeneous condition that affects 4 to 20% of women of reproductive age worldwide and relates to reproductive, metabolic, and psychosocial dysfunction. Dietary and lifestyle modifications have been proposed to play a central role in the management of PCOS. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive systemic overview of the existing literature on the effects of intermittent fasting (IF) and calorie restriction (CR) regimens on disease markers of PCOS.",
      "DESIGNS AND METHODS": "Several databases, such as CINAHL, Cochrane, EBSCOhost, EMBASE, Google Scholar, ProQuest Medical, PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials and observational studies examined the effects of IF regimens such as time-restricted eating and Ramadan model of IF (RIF) on glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, inflammatory and hormonal markers in patients with PCOS.",
      "RESULTS": "This systematic review solicited three articles, comprising a collective sample size of 75 females diagnosed with PCOS. The studies were published between 2015 to 2023 and were undertaken in three countries: China, Turkey, and Iran. The research articles examined the effects of intervention with IF and CR on PCOS-related parameters such as anthropometric measures and biochemical tests which included enzymes, glycemic control, lipid profile, hormonal, and oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers. The articles yielded mixed results, with two of them showing significant changes across all tested parameters. One of the three studies did not exhibit any significant changes.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Very limited studies examined the relationship between IR and CR with markers of PCOS. Further well-controlled studies need to be undertaken the combined results from the limited studies illustrate the intricate and diverse nature of IF, including the RIF, and its influence on measurements of body composition and biochemical markers related to PCOS."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obesity and its related metabolic diseases bring great challenges to public health. In-depth understanding on the efficacy of weight-loss interventions is critical for long-term weight control. Our study demonstrated the comparable efficacy of exercise (EX), intermittent fasting (IF), or the change of daily diet from an unhealthy to a normal chow (DR) for weight reduction, but largely divergently affected metabolic status and transcriptome of subcutaneous fat, scapular brown fat, skeletal muscles and liver in high-fat-high-fructose diet (HFHF) induced obese mice. EX and IF reduced systematic inflammation, improved glucose and lipid metabolism in liver and muscle, and amino acid metabolism and thermogenesis in adipose tissues. EX exhibited broad regulatory effects on TCA cycle, carbon metabolism, thermogenesis, propanoate-, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism across multiple tissues. IF prominently affected genes involved in mitophagy and autophagy in adipose tissues and core genes involved in butanoate metabolism in liver. DR, however, failed to improve metabolic homeostasis and biological dysfunctions in obese mice. Notably, by exploring potential inter-organ communication, we identified an obesity-resistant-like gene profile that were strongly correlated with HFHF induced metabolic derangements and could predict the degree of weight regain induced by the follow-up HFHF diet. Among them, 12 genes (e.g., Gdf15, Tfrc, Cdv3, Map2k4, and Nqo1) were causally associated with human metabolic traits, i.e., BMI, body fat mass, HbA1C, fasting glucose, and cholesterol. Our findings provide critical groundwork for improved understanding of the impacts of weight-loss interventions on host metabolism. The identified genes predicting weight regain may be considered regulatory targets for improving long-term weight control."

    "abstract": {
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW": "Time-restricted eating (TRE), a form of intermittent fasting, restricts feeding time across the day, imposing a daily 'eating window'. The time of day when the eating window occurs could result in differential metabolic effects. Here, we describe recent intervention studies in humans assessing the metabolic consequences of an early- (i.e., eating window starting in the early morning) vs. late (i.e., eating window starting after midday)-TRE protocol.",
      "RECENT FINDINGS": "Well-controlled studies indicate that both TRE protocols effectively reduce body weight and improve altered glucose metabolism, lipid profile, inflammation, or blood pressure levels. An early-TRE (e-TRE) might have a further positive impact on improving blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance. However, the studies directly assessing the metabolic consequences of an early- vs. late-TRE have shown dissimilar findings, and more well-controlled clinical trials are needed on the metabolic benefits of these two types of TRE. Evidence suggests that an e-TRE might have enhanced metabolic results, particularly regarding glucose homeostasis. More long-term studies, including larger sample sizes, are needed to assess the metabolic, circadian, and adherence benefits, together with socio-cultural acceptance of both TRE approaches."

      "OBJECTIVE": "To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a single-session implantation of spinal cord electrical stimulation with neurophysiological monitoring a spinal cord electrical stimulator under general anesthesia with neurophysiological monitoring for the treatment of high-risk diabetic foot.",
      "METHODS": "The clinical data of seven patients with high-risk diabetic foot who underwent spinal cord electrical stimulation in neurosurgery ward nine of Tianjin Huanhu Hospital from May 2022 to May 2023 were collected. The operation was performed under general anesthesia with the \"C\" arm X ray machine guidance and neurophysiological monitoring. The arterial diameter and peak flow rate of lower extremity, lower extremity skin temperature (calf skin temperature, foot skin temperature), visual analog scale (VAS), continuous distance of movement, blood glucose level and toe wound were compared between patients before and after surgery.",
      "RESULTS": "A total of seven patients with high-risk diabetic foot were included. The diameters and peak flow rates of femoral artery, popliteal artery, anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsal foot artery in both lower limbs were significantly improved after surgery. All patients had different degrees of lower limb pain before operation. After operation, VAS score decreased significantly (1.1±0.9 vs. 6.8±3.4), the pain was significantly relieved, and the calf skin temperature and foot skin temperature were significantly higher than those before surgery [calf skin temperature (centigrade): 33.3±0.9 vs. 30.9±0.7, foot skin temperature (centigrade): 31.4±0.8 vs. 29.1±0.6], fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose were significantly lower than those before surgery [fasting blood glucose (mmol/L): 7.6±1.4 vs. 10.5±1.2, postprandial blood glucose (mmol/L): 9.3±2.3 vs. 13.5±1.1], the differences were statistically significant (all P < 0.01). The lower limb movement of all seven patients was significantly improved after surgery, including one patient who needed wheelchair travel before surgery, and one patient who had intermittent claudication before surgery. Among them, one patient needed wheelchair travel and one patient had intermittent claudication before surgery. All patients could walk normally at 2 weeks after operation. Among the seven patients, two patients had the diabetic foot wound ulceration before surgery, which could not heal for a long time. One month after surgery, blood flow around the foot wound recovered and the healing was accelerated. The wound was dry and crusted around the wound, and the wound healed well.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "For diabetic high-risk foot patients who are intolerant to diabetic peripheral neuralgia and local anesthesia spinal cord electrical stimulation test, one-time implantation of spinal cord electrical stimulator under general anesthesia under neurophysiological monitoring can effectively alleviate peripheral neuralgia and other diabetic foot related symptoms, improve lower limb blood supply, and reduce the risk of toe amputation. Clinical practice has proved the effectiveness of this technique, especially for the early treatment of diabetic high-risk foot patients."

    "title": "Intermittent fasting promotes type 3 innate lymphoid cells secreting IL-22 contributing to the beigeing of white adipose tissue.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obesity refers to a condition where a person has excessive fat accumulation, which can have negative impacts on their health. Managing obesity has typically relied on reducing energy intake and increasing energy use through diets and exercise. For example, intermittent fasting is a diet strategy involving periods of time in a day or week where a person does not eat any food. Research has shown that intermittent fasting may improve the metabolism and increase energy use by enhancing a process known as “beigeing” of white fat tissue. In this process, white fat cells or their precursor cells differentiate into beige fat cells, which can consume excess energy by burning fat. Consequently, understanding how beigeing of white fat cells is activated in intermittent fasting may reveal a promising strategy for tackling obesity and metabolic diseases. Immune cells found in the gut known as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) may play a role in the metabolic benefits from intermittent fasting. However, the roles of ILCs are complex: some types of ILCs can promote obesity, while others show metabolic benefits through their release of proteins like IL-17 and IL-22, which can help the body to metabolise glucose. To find out if these immune cells play a role in intermittent fasting, Chen, Sun et al. used diet-induced obese mice that had to fast every other day. Intermittent fasting was found to cause a form of ILCs (ILC3s) to release IL-22, which resulted in beigeing of white fat cells in obese mice. Single-cell sequencing techniques of gut immune cells further revealed that intermittent fasting increased forms of signalling in ILC3s and caused ILC3s to interact with other immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. The findings demonstrate how intermittent fasting causes beigeing of white adipose tissue through ILC3s, revealing mechanisms underpinning the metabolic benefits found from intermittent fasting. More research into this process may help identify new targets for treating obesity."

    "title": "Intermittent Fasting-Improved Glucose Homeostasis Is Not Entirely Dependent on Caloric Restriction in db/db Male Mice.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF), which involves prolonged fasting intervals accompanied by caloric restriction (CR), is an effective dietary treatment for obesity and diabetes. Although IF offers many benefits, it is difficult to determine whether these benefits are the consequences of CR. Every-other-day feeding (EODF) is a commonly used IF research model. This study was designed to identify factors, in addition to CR, responsible for the effects of EODF and the possible underlying mechanisms. Diabetic db/db mice were divided into three groups: ad libitum (AL), meal feeding (MF), and EODF. The MF model was used to attain a level of CR comparable to that of EODF, with food distribution evenly divided between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., thereby minimizing the fasting interval. EODF yielded greater improvements in glucose homeostasis than MF in db/db mice by reducing fasting glucose levels and enhancing glucose tolerance. However, these effects on glucose metabolism were less pronounced in lean mice. Furthermore, ubiquitination of the liver-specific glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR) facilitated its degradation and downregulation of Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9), which ultimately suppressed liver gluconeogenesis in diabetic EODF mice. Although GR and KLF9 might mediate the metabolic benefits of EODF, the potential benefits of EODF might be limited by elevated serum GC levels in diabetic EODF mice. Overall, this study suggests that the metabolic benefits of EODF in improving glucose homeostasis are independent of CR, possibly because of the downstream effects of liver-specific GR degradation."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF) and its numerous modifications have been increasingly suggested as a promising therapy for age-related problems and a non-pharmacological strategy to extend lifespan. Despite the great variability in feeding schedules that we describe in the current work, underlying physiological processes are the same and include a periodic switch from glucose metabolism (generated by glycogenolysis) to fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones. Many of the beneficial effects of IF appear to be mediated by optimization of energy utilization. Findings to date from both human and animal experiments indicate that fasting improves physiological function, enhances performance, and slows aging and disease processes. In this review, we discuss some of the remarkable discoveries about the beneficial effects of IF on metabolism, endocrine and cardiovascular systems, cancer prevention, brain health, neurodegeneration and aging. Experimental studies on rodent models and human investigations are summarized to compare the outcomes and underlying mechanisms of IF. Metabolic and cellular responses triggered by IF could help to achieve the aim of preventing disease, and maximizing healthspan and longevity with minimal side effects."

      "BACKGROUND": "The concept of time-restricted eating (TRE) or time-restricted feeding (TRF) promotes daily periods of feeding and fasting to determine whole-body physiology. Chronic misalignment of circadian rhythms or chrono-disruption is related to an increased risk of diverse metabolic disorders. The progression of non-communicable diseases seems to be affected by the timing of meals. As a result, intermittent fasting is a promising approach for their management. The aim of the present literature review is to examine and scrutinize the TRE protocols in the fields of prevention and management of metabolic disorders.",
      "METHODS": "This is a thorough literature review of the reported associations among circadian rhythm, metabolic disorders, diabetes mellitus, obesity, TRE, TRF, dietary habits, circadian disruption, cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver to find the already existing clinical studies from the last decade (2014-2024) in the most precise scientific online databases, using relevant specific keywords. Several inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to scrutinize only longitudinal, cross-sectional, descriptive, and prospective clinical human studies.",
      "RESULTS": "The currently available clinical findings remain scarce and suggest that chrononutrition behaviors such as TRE or TRF may promote several metabolic benefits, mainly in body weight control and fat loss. Improvements in glucose levels and lipid profiles are currently quite controversial since some clinical studies show little or no effect. As far as liver diseases are concerned, the efficacy of intermittent fasting seems to be stronger in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease due to body weight decline and fat loss.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Even if there has been a gradual increase in clinical studies in the last few years, providing promising perspectives, currently, there is no conclusive evidence for the role of chrononutrition in metabolic disorders. Future studies should be well-designed with longer duration and larger sample sizes. Moreover, it is important to examine the best timing of the eating window and its feasibility."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is associated with both cardiovascular and bladder dysfunction. Insulin resistance (IR) and central obesity, in particular, are the main risk factors. In these patients, vicious pathological cycles exacerbate abnormal carbohydrate metabolism and sustain an inflammatory state, with serious implications for both the heart and bladder. Ketone bodies serve as an alternative energy source in this context. They are considered a \"super-fuel\" because they generate adenosine triphosphate with less oxygen consumption per molecule, thus enhancing metabolic efficiency. Ketone bodies have a positive impact on all components of MS. They aid in weight loss and glycemic control, lower blood pressure, improve lipid profiles, and enhance endothelial function. Additionally, they possess direct anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasodilatory properties. A shared key player in dysfunction of both the heart and bladder dysfunction is the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which ketone bodies inhibit. Interventions that elevate ketone body levels-such as fasting, a ketogenic diet, ketone supplements, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors-have been shown to directly affect cardiovascular outcomes and improve lower urinary tract symptoms derived from MS. This review explores the pathophysiological basis of the benefits of ketone bodies in cardiac and bladder dysfunction."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) may play an important role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the exact mechanism of CIH-induced myocardial injury in DCM remains unclear. In vivo, the db/db mice exposed to CIH were established, and in vitro, the H9C2 cells were exposed to high glucose (HG) combined with intermittent hypoxia (IH). The body weight (BW), fasting blood glucose (FBG) and food intake were measured every two weeks. The glycolipid metabolism was assessed with the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin resistance (IR). Cardiac function was detected by echocardiography. Cardiac pathology was detected by HE staining, Masson staining, and transmission electron microscopy. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in myocardial tissue was detected by dihydroethidium (DHE). The apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. The cell viability, ROS, and the mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and related kits. Western blotting was used to analyze the liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase/ nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (LKB1/AMPK/Nrf2) signaling pathway. CIH exposure accelerated glycolipid metabolism disorders and cardiac injury, and increased the level of cardiac oxidative stress and the number of positive apoptotic cells in db/db mice. IH and HG decreased the cell viability and the level of mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased ROS expression in H9C2 cells. These findings indicate that CIH exposure promotes glycolipid metabolism disorders and myocardial apoptosis, aggravating myocardial injury via the LKB1/AMPK/Nrf2 pathway in vitro and in vivo."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "This study assesses the feasibility of calorie restriction (CR) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) in overweight and obese cancer patients who realized little to no physical activity undergoing curative radiotherapy, structured as a prospective, interventional, non-randomized open-label clinical trial. Of the 27 participants initially enrolled, 21 patients with breast cancer were selected for analysis. The participants self-selected into two dietary interventions: TRF, comprising a sugar and saturated fat-free diet calibrated to individual energy needs consumed within an 8 h eating window followed by a 16 h fast, or CR, involving a 25% reduction in total caloric intake from energy expenditure distributed across 4 meals and 1 snack with 55% carbohydrates, 15% protein, and 30% fats, excluding sugars and saturated fats. The primary goal was to evaluate the feasibility of these diets in the specific patient group. The results indicate that both interventions are effective and statistically significant for weight loss and reducing one's waist circumference, with TRF showing a potentially stronger impact and better adherence. Changes in the LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and insulin were not statistically significant."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "The aging of white adipose tissue (WAT) involves senescence of adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs) and dysregulation of immune cell populations, serving as a major driver of age-associated adipose dysfunction and metabolic diseases. Conversely, the elimination of senescent ASPCs is associated with improvements in overall health. Intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary intervention that incorporates periodic cycles of fasting and refeeding, has been reported to promote weight loss and fat mass reduction and improve glucose and insulin homeostasis in both murine and human studies. While previous studies have assessed the effects of IF on obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction, few studies have examined the aging-specific changes to ASPCs and immune cell populations in WAT. Here, we show that IF in 18-20-month-old mice reduced senescent phenotypes of ASPCs and restored their adipogenic potential. Intriguingly, IF-treated mice exhibited an increase in adipose eosinophils, which has been reported to be associated with improved WAT homeostasis and immunological fitness in aged mice. The observed cellular and metabolic changes suggest that IF may be a feasible lifestyle regimen to reduce cellular senescence which could result in attenuation of downstream aging-induced WAT dysfunction and metabolic diseases."

      "SUMMARY": "This meta-analysis compared the effectiveness of different energy-restricted diets on body composition, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism in overweight and obese populations. Five databases were searched to identify relevant studies in English from inception until July 20, 2023, for randomized controlled trials of at least 2 weeks duration assessing the effects of continuous energy-restricted diets compared with any intermittent energy-restricted diet in obesity adults. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool version 2.0, while the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. A non-informative prior distribution Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted. Thirty-eight studies (3039 participants) assessing four energy-restricted diets were included. Three RCTs were at high risk of bias with a very low to moderate certainty of evidence. Combined with pairwise comparisons and surface under the cumulative ranking curve, alternate-day fasting may be the best energy restriction regimen with the potential to have the most beneficial effects on various aspects of the obesity population. More rigorously designed and long-term follow-up studies are warranted."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "The efficacy of intermittent fasting (IF), as an emerging weight management strategy, in improving cardiometabolic health has been evaluated in various populations, but that among Chinese individuals has not been systematically studied. A comprehensive search on multiple databases was performed to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to October 2022. The primary outcome was post-intervention weight loss, and secondary outcomes included changes in cardiometabolic indicators. Effect estimates were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. In total, nine RCTs with 899 Chinese participants were included. Time-restricted eating was the most adopted IF protocol in this study (six out of nine), followed by alternate-day fasting. The IF intervention significantly reduced body weight, body mass index, body fat mass, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with control groups. However, no statistically significant reductions in waist circumference, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were found. To sum up, IF can be a weight management strategy and may improve the cardiometabolic health of Chinese adults, but more long-term trials using different IF strategies are required to generate robust evidence of its efficacy."

      "CONTEXT": "Ramadan is a holy month of fasting, spiritual reflection, and worship for Muslims worldwide. However, the Ramadan fast - which involves abstaining from all food and drink, sunrise to sunset for 29 days-30 days annually - may also influence physical health outcomes, especially relating to the risk of metabolic syndrome.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "The literature from the top of the pyramid of evidence was gathered and synthesized for this comprehensive umbrella review and meta-analysis of meta-analyses in order to provide an overall conclusion on the impact of Ramadan fasting with regard to metabolic syndrome components.",
      "DATA EXTRACTION": "Eleven systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included in the current umbrella review. Nine components, including waist circumference, body weight), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure), and fasting blood plasma glucose were analyzed.",
      "DATA ANALYSIS": "The random-effects meta-analysis results revealed standard mean differences as follows: waist circumference -0.30 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.33 to -0.27), body weight -0.34 (95% CI -0.39 to -0.29), high-density lipoprotein 0.20 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.30), low-density lipoprotein -0.10 (95% CI -0.13 to -0.07), total cholesterol -0.15 (95% CI -0.21 to -0.09), triglycerides -0.16 (95% CI -0.24 to -0.08), systolic blood pressure -0.20 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.17), diastolic blood pressure -0.20 (95% CI -0.22 to -0.18), fasting blood plasma glucose -0.10 (95% CI -0.12 to -0.08).",
      "CONCLUSION": "Ramadan fasting appears to benefit body weight, lipid profile, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose levels. Therefore, engaging in fasting during Ramadan may contribute to weight reduction, decreased cardiovascular disease risk, improved blood pressure, and enhanced glycemic control. Nevertheless, the methodological quality of the included reviews ranged from low to critically low, necessitating cautious interpretation of conclusions drawn from these data.",

      "SUMMARY": "The brain neurotramsmitter dopamine may play an important role in modulating systemic glucose homeostasis. In seven hundred and four drug- naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia, we provide robust evidence of positive associations between negative symptoms of schizophrenia and high fasting blood glucose. We then show that glucose metabolism and negative symptoms are improved when intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) on prefrontal cortex (PFC) is performed in patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia. These findings led us to hypothesize that the prefrontal cortical dopamine deficit, which is known to be associated with negative symptoms, may be responsible for abnormal glucose metabolism in schizophrenia. To explore this, we optogenetically and chemogenetically inhibited the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dopamine projection in mice and found both procedures caused glucose intolerance. Moreover, microinjection of dopamine two receptor (D2R) neuron antagonists into mPFC in mice significantly impaired glucose tolerance. Finally, a transgenic mouse model of psychosis named Disc1"

      "OBJECTIVE": "To compare the fasting experience and glycemic control during Ramadan among people with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) who use automated insulin delivery (AID) versus other modalities of treatment.",
      "RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS": "A total of 294 PWT1D who attempted fasting during Ramadan in 2022 were categorized on the basis of treatment modality into one of five groups: 1) AID (n = 62); 2) conventional pump + continuous glucose monitoring (CGM; n = 37); 3) pump + self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG; n = 8); 4) multiple daily injections (MDI) + CGM (n = 155); and 5) MDI + SMBG (n = 32). Predictors of fasting most days of Ramadan (i.e., breaking fast ≤2 days because of diabetes) were analyzed using uni- and multivariable logistic regression.",
      "RESULTS": "The median numbers of days when fasting was broken because of diabetes were 2, 5, 3, 3.5, and 2.5 for AID, conventional pump + CGM, MDI + CGM, pump + SMBG, and MDI + SMBG users, respectively (P = 0.047). Users of AID had a significantly greater time in range (TIR) and lower glycemia risk index, time below range, and time above range compared with users of conventional pumps and MDI (both P < 0.05). Likewise, 53% of AID users attained the double target of 1) breaking fast ≤2 days because of diabetes and 2) maintaining TIR ≥70% during Ramadan compared with only 3% of the conventional pump users and 44% of the MDI + CGM users (both P < 0.05). Compared with MDI + CGM users, AID users were twice as likely to complete fasting most days of Ramadan.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Use of AID is associated with the highest rates of fasting and best glycemic control during Ramadan fasting."

    "title": "Biological sex-related differences in the postprandial triglyceride response to intermittent hypoxaemia in young adults: a randomized crossover trial.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxaemia and is independently associated with an increased risk of metabolic comorbidities (e.g. type II diabetes and ischaemic heart disease). These comorbidities could be attributable to hypoxaemia-induced alterations in blood lipid profiles. However, it remains unclear whether intermittent hypoxaemia alters triglyceridaemia differently between biological sexes. Therefore, we used a randomized crossover design to examine whether 6 h of moderate intermittent hypoxaemia (15 hypoxaemic cycles/h, 85% oxyhaemoglobin saturation) alters plasma triglyceride levels differently between men and women after a high-fat meal. Relative to men, women displayed lower levels of total triglycerides, in addition to denser triglyceride-rich lipoprotein triglycerides (TRL-TG; mainly very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides and chylomicron remnant triglycerides) and buoyant TRL-TG (mainly chylomicron triglycerides) during normoxia (ambient air) and intermittent hypoxaemia (sex × time: all P ≤ 0.008). Intermittent hypoxaemia led to higher triglyceride levels (condition: all P ≤ 0.016); however, this effect was observed only in men (sex × condition: all P ≤ 0.002). Compared with normoxia, glucose levels were higher in men and lower in women during intermittent hypoxaemia (sex × condition: P < 0.001). The different postprandial responses between biological sexes occurred despite similar reductions in mean oxyhaemoglobin saturation and similar elevations in insulin levels, non-esterified fatty acid levels and mean heart rate (sex × condition: all P ≥ 0.185). These results support growing evidence showing that intermittent hypoxaemia impacts men and women differently, and they might help to explain biological sex-related discrepancies in the rate of certain comorbidities associated with intermittent hypoxaemia. KEY POINTS: Intermittent hypoxaemia is a key characteristic of obstructive sleep apnoea and alters lipid metabolism in multiple tissues, resulting in increased circulating triglyceride levels, an important risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases. Circulating triglyceride levels are regulated differently between biological sexes, with women typically displaying much lower fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels than men, partly explaining why women of all ages experience lower mortality rates from cardiometabolic diseases. In this study, healthy young men and women consumed a high-fat meal and were then exposed to 6 h of intermittent hypoxaemia or ambient air. We show that postprandial triglyceride levels are significantly lower in women compared with men and that intermittent hypoxaemia leads to higher postprandial triglyceride levels in men only. These results might help us to understand better why women living with obstructive sleep apnoea experience lower rates of cardiometabolic diseases (e.g. type II diabetes and ischaemic heart disease) than men living with obstructive sleep apnoea."

    "title": "Association of Christian Orthodox Fasting with Sociodemographic, Anthropometric and Lifestyle Factors and Serum Biochemical Indices: A Cross-Sectional Study on Patients with Metabolic Diseases.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Christian Orthodox fasting, a type of time-restricted diet, which presents some similarities to the Mediterranean Diet, also including certain similarities with periodic vegetarianism or other time-restricted diets (e.g., intermittent diet and Ramadan fasting), may cumulatively be related to the same or even better beneficial healthy effects as these well-recognized dietary patterns. The present study aimed to explore the potential beneficial impact of Christian Orthodox fasting in patients with metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus type 2, excessive obesity, hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. This was a cross-sectional study, including 135 patients with metabolic disorders (67 fasters and 68 non-fasters). The enrolled fasters had adapted Christian Orthodox fasting recommendations for at least twelve consecutive years or even from childhood. Relevant questionnaires were used to record sociodemographic, anthropometric and lifestyle data of the study population through face-to-face interviews between the enrolled individuals and qualified personnel during a non-fasting period. Christian Orthodox fasting patients showed a significantly and independently lower prevalence of overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity, which is highly associated with cardiometabolic disease risks, as well as a significantly and independently lower incidence of hypertension, including separately lower systolic and diastolic pressure, than non-fasting patients. Fasters also had a significantly and independently increased prevalence of an advanced educational level and no smoking history, as well as a lower incidence of sedentary behavior, and a trend of a correlation with reduced c-reactive protein (CRP), an indicator of inflammation, compared to non-fasters. Fasters also exhibited higher serum albumin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, as well as lower glucose levels, than non-fasters. This is one of the few cross-sectional studies demonstrating that Christian Orthodox fasting may promote metabolic health by improving several aspects of metabolic disorders, being associated with specific sociodemographic, anthropometric and lifestyle factors. Further studies conducted on larger sample sizes from different countries and different ethnicities that include Christian Orthodox fasters are recommended to evaluate the impact of long-term religious fasting effects on human health, either as a preventative factor reducing the risk of chronic diseases and especially cardiometabolic disorders or as a nutritional intervention to ameliorate symptom severity."

      "METHODS": "We used sham-operated or orchiectomized (ORX) mice exposed to normoxia (Nx) or IH for 2 weeks. We performed fasting insulin and glucose tolerance tests and assessed fasting and postprandial insulin resistance with the HOMA-IR. The activity of hepatic prooxidant (NADPH oxidase-NOX), antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase-SOD, Cat, GPx), lipid peroxidation (MDA concentration), and the total concentration of glutathione (GSH) were measured under postprandial conditions. mRNA sequencing and pathway enrichment analyses were used to identify hepatic genes underlying the interactions between IH and testosterone.",
      "RESULTS": "In Sham mice, IH improves fasting insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, while there are no effects of IH in ORX mice. In ORX mice, IH induces postprandial hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and a prooxidant profile of enzyme activity (low SOD activity) without altering hepatic MDA and GSH content. ORX and IH altered the expression of genes involved in oxidoreductase activities, cytochromes-dependent pathways, and glutathione metabolism. Among the genes upregulated in ORX-IH mice, the flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) are particularly relevant since these are potent hepatic antioxidants that could help prevent overt oxidative stress in ORX-IH mice.",

      "RESULTS": "From 12343 articles identified in different databases, a total of 7 RCT arms were entered into the quantitative synthesis. The manuscripts were published between 2019 and 2023. IF regimens (the 5:2 diet, 16/8 time-restricting feeding, and alternate day fasting) varied from 2 months to 3 months. IF regimens reduced steatosis scores (WMD: -33.22 CAP dB/m, 95 % CI: -50.72 to -15.72), anthropometric characteristics of obesity (WMD: -0.77 kg/m",
      "CONCLUSION": "IF regimens can improve some markers of cardiometabolic and liver function in patients with NAFLD. However, the available evidence to support the benefits of IF regimens is limited and derived from a small number of studies, thus further research is needed to clarify the impact of IF on the cardiometabolic health of NAFLD patients."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting has become of interest for its possible metabolic benefits and reduction of inflammation and oxidative damage, all of which play a role in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. We tested in a streptozotocin (60 mg/kg)-induced diabetic apolipoprotein E knockout mouse model whether repeated fasting mimicking diet (FMD) prevents glomerular damage. Diabetic mice received 5 FMD cycles in 10 wk, and during cycles 1 and 5 caloric measurements were performed. After 10 wk, glomerular endothelial morphology was determined together with albuminuria, urinary heparanase-1 activity, and spatial mass spectrometry imaging to identify specific glomerular metabolic dysregulation. During FMD cycles, blood glucose levels dropped while a temporal metabolic switch was observed to increase fatty acid oxidation. Overall body weight at the end of the study was reduced together with albuminuria, although urine production was dramatically increased without affecting urinary heparanase-1 activity. Weight loss was found to be due to lean mass and water, not fat mass. Although capillary loop morphology and endothelial glycocalyx heparan sulfate contents were preserved, hyaluronan surface expression was reduced together with the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid. Mass spectrometry imaging further revealed reduced protein catabolic breakdown products and increased oxidative stress, not different from diabetic mice. In conclusion, although FMD preserves partially glomerular endothelial glycocalyx, loss of lean mass and increased glomerular oxidative stress argue whether such diet regimes are safe in patients with diabetes."

Among individuals ≥40 years old who were free of diabetes or cancer, 1,430,054 who underwent national health examinations over 4 consecutive years from 2009 to 2012 were selected and followed up until gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2019. The IFG exposure score (range, 0-4) was based on the number of IFG diagnoses over 4 years.",
      "RESULTS": "The median follow-up duration was 6.4 years.

However, the cumulative effect of impaired fasting glucose on the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancer remains unclear. A frequent diagnosis of impaired fasting glucose was dose-dependently associated with a higher risk of developing overall gastrointestinal cancer. Furthermore, risks of individual cancer types increased with persistent impaired fasting glucose. Early detection of hyperglycemia and strict glycemic control can lower the risk of gastrointestinal cancer by reducing hyperglycemic burden. Additionally, for some individuals, lifestyle changes such as managing metabolic syndrome or abstaining from alcohol may also be helpful."

      "BACKGROUND": "Research on intermittent fasting has shown that it can improve a variety of health outcomes, including blood sugar control, blood lipid levels and blood pressure. Only few studies document longer periods of fasting, especially in rehabilitation participants. Cardiac inpatient rehabilitation follows a multidisciplinary approach including change of health behaviour to reduce patients' risk of future cardiovascular events. To date, evidence suggests that intermittent fasting can be an effective way to improve health and well-being, but more research is needed to fully understand its long-term effects and factors that promote the implementation. Therefore, the aim of the ongoing InterVFast trial is to investigate the effectiveness of intermittent fasting amongst cardiac rehabilitation patients after 4-week inpatient rehabilitation as well as 3 and 12 months subsequently including patients' perspective.",
      "METHODS": "This single-centre randomized controlled trial evaluates the effectiveness of the InterVFast intervention in weight loss (primary outcome). We also examine patients' acceptance and the effect on relevant outcomes as blood glucose and triglyceride levels, cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Weight, blood samples and clinical data are collected as part of the initial and final examination during inpatient rehabilitation. During inpatient rehabilitation, participants daily note fasting intervals and meals eaten as well as practicability in a fasting diary. In addition, interviews about perceived advantages and disadvantages and acceptance are carried out with the participants in the IG. A standardized follow-up examination (weight, blood samples) will be carried out by the family doctor after 3 and 12 months (t2 and t3).",
      "DISCUSSION": "Compared to other weight-loss intervention studies, our study addresses patients with coronary heart disease and includes patients' acceptance as well as long-term maintenance. It is hypothesized that participation in the InterVfast intervention will improve relevant health outcomes in a sample of cardiac rehabilitation patients and thus constitute a behavioural prevention strategy to reduce the risk of future cardiac events and improve overall health and quality of life.",

    "title": "Transient anticonvulsant effects of time-restricted feeding in the 6-Hz mouse model.",
    "abstract": {
      "INTRODUCTION": "Intermittent fasting enhances neural bioenergetics, is neuroprotective, and elicits antioxidant effects in various animal models. There are conflicting findings on seizure protection, where intermittent fasting regimens often cause severe weight loss resembling starvation which is unsustainable long-term. Therefore, we tested whether a less intensive intermittent fasting regimen such as time-restricted feeding (TRF) may confer seizure protection.",
      "METHODS": "Male CD1 mice were assigned to either ad libitum-fed control, continuous 8 h TRF, or 8 h TRF with weekend ad libitum food access (2:5 TRF) for one month. Body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels were measured. Seizure thresholds were determined at various time points using 6-Hz and maximal electroshock seizure threshold (MEST) tests. Protein levels and mRNA expression of genes, enzyme activity related to glucose metabolism, as well as mitochondrial dynamics were assessed in the cortex and hippocampus. Markers of antioxidant defence were evaluated in the plasma, cortex, and liver.",
      "RESULTS": "Body weight gain was similar in the ad libitum-fed and TRF mouse groups. In both TRF regimens, blood glucose levels did not change between the fed and fasted state and were higher during fasting than in the ad libitum-fed groups. Mice in the TRF group had increased seizure thresholds in the 6-Hz test on day 15 and on day 19 in a second cohort of 2:5 TRF mice, but similar seizure thresholds at other time points compared to ad libitum-fed mice. Continuous TRF did not alter MEST seizure thresholds on day 28. Mice in the TRF group showed increased maximal activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the cortex, which was accompanied by increased protein levels of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 in the cortex and hippocampus. There were no other major changes in protein or mRNA levels associated with energy metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics in the brain, nor markers of antioxidant defence in the brain, liver, or plasma.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Both continuous and 2:5 TRF regimens transiently increased seizure thresholds in the 6-Hz model at around 2 weeks, which coincided with stability of blood glucose levels during the fed and fasted periods. Our findings suggest that the lack of prolonged anticonvulsant effects in the acute electrical seizure models employed may be attributed to only modest metabolic and antioxidant adaptations found in the brain and liver. Our findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of TRF in managing seizure-related conditions."

    "abstract": {
      "INTRODUCTION AND AIM": "Exercise training (Ex) and intermittent fasting (IF) are effective for improving body composition and cardiometabolic health overweight and obese adults, but whether combining Ex and IF induces additive or synergistic effects is less well established. We therefore, performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the combined versus independent effects of Ex and IF on body composition and cardiometabolic health in adults.",
      "METHOD": "An electronic search was conducted in three main online databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, from inception to March 9, 2023 for studies involving Ex plus IF trials versus standalone Ex and/or IF interventions in adults. Interventions had a duration of ≥ 2 weeks. Standardized (SMD) or weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated in order to compare effects on body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat lean body mass (LBM), visceral fat, and waist circumference. For cardiometabolic health, outcomes included fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and VO",
      "RESULTS": "Ex plus IF decreased body weight [WMD: -3.03 kg (95% CI: -3.44 to -2.61), p = 0.001], BMI [WMD: -1.12 kg.m",
      "CONCLUSION": "We demonstrate that a combination of Ex and IF produces superior changes in body composition, but not in markers of cardiometabolic health when compared with Ex or IF alone. Ex plus IF could therefore be effective for weight and fat loss but has no additive or synergistic effects for other cardiometabolic health markers."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is a commonly used dietary practice that alternates between periods of unrestricted dietary consumption and abstinence from caloric intake. IF reduces caloric intake along with metabolic switch from utilization of glucose to fatty acids and ketones and resulting in reduction in adiposity and subsequently insulin resistance. Thus, it has been hypothesized that IF regimens can improve body composition in obese and overweight individuals.",
      "AIM": "To assess the effect of IF on lipid biokinetics in obese and overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS": "Thirty overweight or obese T2D patients were recruited from the diabetes outpatient clinics at the Specialized Medical Hospital, Mansoura University. Patients were subjected to time restricted fasting for 16 h (from dawn to sunset) during Ramadan. Anthropometric data were measured for participants before and 3 weeks after Ramadan fasting. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, lipid profile, leptin, beta hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and high sensitive CRP levels were measured 1 week before and 3 weeks after Ramadan fasting.",
      "RESULTS": "30 diabetic patients were recruited with a mean age of 54.3 ± 7.2 years. 24 (80%) were females. Obesity was diagnosed in 27 cases (90%). The median diabetes duration was 10 years. The study showed a statistically significant decrease in post-fasting body weight (BW), Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) & hip circumference (HC). There was a statistically significant decrease of post-fasting low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), Total cholesterol (TC), and leptin. The study also showed a statistically significant increase of post-fasting high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and βHB. No significant change was found in post-fasting levels of HbA1c, FPG, triglycerides (TG) or high sensitive CRP. Post-fasting leptin was positively correlated with post-fasting BW, BMI, WC, and HC. Post-fasting βHB was positively correlated with post-fasting TG, HbA1c, and LDL-C. Leptin levels change (pre vs post fasting) was positively correlated with the change in LDL-C levels.",
      "CONCLUSION": "IF reduced leptin and increased β-hydroxybutyrate levels. IF is an effective tool for losing weight and visceral fat and improving lipid profile in obese and overweight patients with T2D."

    "title": "Dietary approaches for exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Renewed interest in tumor metabolism sparked an enthusiasm for dietary interventions to prevent and treat cancer. Changes in diet impact circulating nutrient levels in the plasma and the tumor microenvironment, and preclinical studies suggest that dietary approaches, including caloric and nutrient restrictions, can modulate tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Cancers are heterogeneous in their metabolic dependencies and preferred energy sources and can be addicted to glucose, fructose, amino acids, or lipids for survival and growth. This dependence is influenced by tumor type, anatomical location, tissue of origin, aberrant signaling, and the microenvironment. This review summarizes nutrient dependencies and the related signaling pathway activations that provide targets for nutritional interventions. We examine popular dietary approaches used as adjuvants to anticancer therapies, encompassing caloric restrictions, including time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting, fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs), and nutrient restrictions, notably the ketogenic diet. Despite promising results, much of the knowledge on dietary restrictions comes from in vitro and animal studies, which may not accurately reflect real-life situations. Further research is needed to determine the optimal duration, timing, safety, and efficacy of dietary restrictions for different cancers and treatments. In addition, well-designed human trials are necessary to establish the link between specific metabolic vulnerabilities and targeted dietary interventions. However, low patient compliance in clinical trials remains a significant challenge."

    "abstract": {
      "INTRODUCTION": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic disease characterized by repetitive complete or partial occlusion of the upper airways during sleep with respiratory muscle effort, which leads to consecutive apneas and hypopneas. Obstruction of the upper airways during sleep leads to repetitive episodes of disrupted airflow and consequent changes in blood oxygenation, resulting in hypoxaemia and hypercapnia. Intermittent hypoxaemia induces the production of pro-inflammatory factors and promotes metabolic dysregulation and platelet aggregation.",
      "OBJECTIVE": "The main aim of this study was to determine differences, if any, in selected standard parameters in routine laboratory tests often used in GP practice between patients with obstructive sleep apnea, without comorbidities, and a well-defined control group with the absence of this syndrome proven in polygraphic examination.",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS": "Of the 192 clinically assessed persons with suspected OSA and admitted to the Internal Medicine Department in Lublin, 85 were qualified for the study after application of exclusion criteria. Demographic and health behaviour-related data, medical history regarding sleep habits and cardiovascular disease, were collected from each patient.",
      "RESULTS": "Apart from significantly higher MCV and MCH among the cpontrol group, no significant differences were found between patients with obstructive sleep apnea and the control group.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "The results can be useful for the holistic assessment of the health status of patients with newly-diagnosed OSA."

      "SUMMARY": "Only 30% of patients with McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS)-associated acromegaly achieve biochemical control under first-generation somatostatin receptor ligands (fg-SRLs), while pegvisomant fails to normalize insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) in >20% of cases. Here, we report all the patients with MAS-associated acromegaly treated with pasireotide long-acting release (LAR) in our center. Pasireotide LAR 20 mg/month resulted in rapid and long-term IGF-I normalization in patients #1 and #3. Patient #3 was resistant to fg-SRLs, while patient #1 was also controlled on fg-SRLs. In patient #2, resistant to fg-SRLs and uncontrolled on pegvisomant 40 mg/day combined with cabergoline 0.5 mg/day, pegvisomant was replaced with pasireotide LAR 40 mg/month, resulting in the near normalization of IGF-I levels. All 3 patients developed intermittent impaired fasting glucose, without the need for glucose-lowering drugs. Thus, pasireotide LAR is clearly useful as third-line therapy, and potentially even as second-line therapy, in MAS-associated acromegaly."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Daily rhythms of metabolic function are supported by molecular circadian clock systems that are strongly regulated by feeding and fasting. Intermittent fasting diets have been associated with weight loss and improved metabolism. However, the effects of time-restricted eating (TRE) on glycemic parameters are still under debate. In this review, we aim to systematically analyze the effects of TRE on glycemic parameters. We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for controlled studies in which subjects followed TRE for at least 4 weeks. 20 studies were included in the qualitative systematic review, and 18 studies (n = 1169 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, TRE had no significant effect on fasting glucose (Hedges's g = -0.08; 95% CI:-0.31,0.16; p = 0.52), but it did reduce HbA1c levels (Hedges's g = -0.27; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.06; p = 0.01). TRE significantly reduced fasting insulin (Hedges's g = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.73,-0.08; p = 0.01) and showed a tendency to decrease HOMA-IR (Hedges's g = -0.32; 95% CI:-0.66,0.02; p = 0.06). Interestingly, a cumulative analysis showed that the beneficial effects of TRE regarding glucose levels were less apparent as studies with later TRE windows (lTRE) were being included. Indeed, a subgroup analysis of the early TRE (eTRE) studies revealed that fasting glucose was significantly reduced by eTRE (Hedges's g = -0.38; 95% CI:-0.62, -0.14; p < 0.01). Our meta-analysis suggests that TRE can reduce HbA1c and insulin levels, and that timing of food intake is a crucial factor in the metabolic benefit of TRE, as only eTRE is capable of reducing fasting glucose levels in subjects with overweight or obesity.PROSPERO registration number CRD42023405946."

      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained increasing scientific and general attention. Most studied forms of IF include alternate-day fasting, modified alternate-day fasting, and time-restricted eating (TRE). Several cardiometabolic effects of IF have been described in animal models and, to a lesser extent, in humans. This review analyzes the impact of IF on weight loss, glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and lipid profile in humans. A literature search was conducted in the Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Controlled observational or interventional studies in humans, published between January 2000 and June 2021, were included. Studies comparing IF versus religious fasting were not included. Most studies indicate that the different types of IF have significant benefits on body composition, inducing weight loss and reducing fat mass. Changes in cardiometabolic parameters show more divergent results. In general, a decrease in fasting glucose and insulin levels is observed, together with an improved lipid profile associated with cardiovascular risk. High heterogeneity in study designs was observed, particularly in studies with TRE, small sample sizes, and short-term interventions. Current evidence shows that IF confers a range of cardiometabolic benefits in humans. Weight loss, improvement of glucose homeostasis and lipid profile, are observed in the three types of IF protocols evaluated."

      "BACKGROUND": "The level of fasting blood glucose (FBG) is influenced by several factors, including health status, genetics, and diet. Some studies have reported a beneficial effect of Ramadan Intermittent Fasting (RIF) on diabetic patients. However, clinical observations have shown that diabetes is exacerbated in some patients.",
      "AIM": "This study aims to investigate the influence of RIF on the FBG level, a biomarker of hyperglycemia and diabetes, and to identify factors associated with variations in FBG levels during RIF among diabetic patients.",
      "METHODS": "This study is a cross-sectional study. We monitored the FBG levels of 181 type II diabetic patients over a two-month period, from 20 February to 20 April 2023, which represents the Islamic lunar months of Shaban (8th month) and Ramadan (9th month). Ramadan provides a prominent month of intermittent fasting practice for studying its physiological effects on diabetes. We collected clinical data from each participant, including demographic information, co-morbidities, and medications used during this period.",
      "RESULTS": "Based on our findings, diabetic patients were classified into three groups depending on the influence of RIF on FBG levels: the positively affected group (44%), whose average FBG levels were reduced; the neutrally affected group (24%), whose average FBG levels did not change; and the negatively affected group (32%), whose average FBG levels increased during the fasting month of Ramadan compared to the previous month. Furthermore, we found that the positive effect of RIF was more frequent among obese, non-geriatric, and male diabetic patients, while the negative effect of RIF was more frequent among patients who were not adhering to the medication.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "This study concludes that RIF affects FBG levels differently among diabetic patients. These findings should be taken into consideration when treating diabetic patients during the fasting month of Ramadan, and further studies are needed to identify (1) factors associated with inter-individual variation in the response to RIF and (2) those who are great candidates for RIF."

To our knowledge, specific guidance on the appropriate period for eating during TRE has not yet been promoted.

      "RESULTS": "Twenty-seven RCTs comparing TRE with different eating windows on human metabolic health were reviewed, and all were included in the NMA. Compared with the normal diet group (non-TRE), the TRE group has certain benefits in reducing weight and fasting insulin. In terms of reducing fasting insulin, the 18:6 group (eating time = 6 h) was better than the 14:10 group (eating time = 10 h) and 16:8 group (eating time = 8 h) (P < 0.05); The < 6 group (eating time < 6 h) was better than the 14:10 group (P < 0.05). In terms of reducing fasting glucose, the < 6 group was better than the 14:10 group (P < 0.05). There were no statistical variations in weight, HDL, TG, and LDL across the different modes of TRE (P > 0.05).",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Our research showed that no particular metabolic advantages of various eating windows were found. Therefore, our results suggested that different eating windows could promote similar benefits for metabolic parameters."

      "OBJECTIVES": "The prevalence of obesity and overweight in children has been increasing rapidly worldwide and threatens society with various chronic diseases that these children are born with. High-protein ketogenic diets and intermittent nutrition are thought to be protective against obesity and metabolic syndrome MetS. However, the exact effects and results, insulin resistance, and the role of leptin in the functioning mechanism of these diets have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of insulin resistance and leptin hormone on the effects of body composition with a high-protein ketogenic diet and intermittent nutrition combination.",
      "METHODS": "Thirty-two young non-obese rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. Both the standard diet and the high-protein ketogenic diet were given ad libitum and intermittently to the rats for 6 wk. The body weight and fat mass of the rats were measured at the end of the experiment. The fasting glucose, leptin, insulin, high- and low-density lipoprotein, and triacylglycerols were measured with the blood samples.",
      "RESULTS": "The lowest body weight was observed in the intermittent and high-protein ketogenic diet group, followed by the free high-protein ketogenic diet and standard intermittent diet group, respectively. Also, the lowest body fat mass was observed in the intermittent and high-protein ketogenic diet group, followed by the standard intermittent diet group. Although there was no change in leptin, insulin, high- and low-density lipoprotein, and triacylglycerol levels in any group, the lowest blood glucose rate was observed in the intermittent and high-protein ketogenic diet group.",
      "CONCLUSION": "The results of the present study revealed that an intermittent high-protein ketogenic diet is more effective than others in weight loss without disrupting biochemical health parameters, and the applied diets do not prevent growth and development."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "The interest in intermittent energy restriction (IER) diets as a weight-loss approach is increasing. Different IER protocols exist, including time-restricted eating (TRE), alternate-day fasting (ADF), and the 5:2 diet. This meta-analysis compared the effects of these IER diets with continuous energy restriction (CER) on anthropometrics and cardiometabolic risk markers in healthy adults. Twenty-eight trials were identified that studied TRE (k = 7), ADF (k = 10), or the 5:2 diet (k = 11) for 2-52 wk. Energy intakes between intervention groups within a study were comparable (17 trials), lower in IER (5 trials), or not reported (6 trials). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models. Changes in body weight [WMD: -0.42 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.96 to 0.13; P = 0.132] and fat mass (FM) (WMD: -0.31 kg; 95% CI: -0.98 to 0.36; P = 0.362) were comparable when results of the 3 IER diets were combined and compared with those of CER. All IER diets combined reduced fat-free mass (WMD: -0.20 kg; 95% CI: -0.39 to -0.01; P = 0.044) and waist circumference (WMD: -0.91 cm; 95% CI: -1.76 to -0.06; P = 0.036) more than CER.

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) lacks effective clinical treatments. As the disease progresses, the cerebral glucose hypometabolism that appears in the preclinical phase of AD gradually worsens, leading to increasingly severe brain energy disorders. This review analyzes the brain energy deficit in AD and its etiology, brain energy rescue strategies based on ketone intervention, the effects and mechanisms of IF, the differences in efficacy between IF and ketogenic diet and the duality of IF. The evidence suggests that brain energy deficits lead to the development and progression of AD pathology. IF, which improves brain energy impairments by promoting ketone metabolism, thus has good therapeutic potential for AD."

      "SUMMARY": "The timing of food intake is a novel dietary component that impacts health. Time-restricted feeding (TRF), a form of intermittent fasting, manipulates food timing. The timing of eating may be an important factor to consider during critical periods, such as pregnancy. Nutrition during pregnancy, too, can have a lasting impact on offspring health. The timing of food intake has not been thoroughly investigated in models of pregnancy, despite evidence that interest in the practice exists. Therefore, using a mouse model, we tested body composition and glycemic health of gestational early TRF (eTRF) in male and female offspring from weaning to adulthood on a chow diet and after a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet challenge. Body composition was similar between groups in both sexes from weaning to adulthood, with minor increases in food intake in eTRF females and slightly improved glucose tolerance in males while on a chow diet. However, after 10 weeks of HFHS, male eTRF offspring developed glucose intolerance. Further studies should assess the susceptibility of males, and apparent resilience of females, to gestational eTRF and assess mechanisms underlying these changes in adult males."

      "BACKGROUND": "The prevalence of obesity is rising globally and effective strategies to treat obesity are needed. Intermittent fasting, a dietary intervention for weight management, has received growing interest from the general public, as well as healthcare professionals, as a form of lifestyle intervention.",
      "METHODS": "We executed a rapid review using PUBMED database to identify systematic reviews that examined the impact of intermittent fasting on metabolic indices, published between 2011 and 2022.",
      "RESULTS": "Intermittent fasting leads to weight loss of a similar magnitude to continuous energy restriction. Most of the evidence shows that intermittent fasting leads to greater fat loss as measured by fat mass (kg) or body fat percentage compared to an ad libitum diet, but fat loss attained during intermittent fasting is not significantly different to continuous energy restriction, although recent evidence shows intermittent fasting to be superior. There is mixed evidence for the impact of intermittent fasting on insulin resistance, fasting glucose and lipid profile. Some studies focused on populations of Muslim people, which showed that Ramadan fasting may lead to weight loss and improvement of metabolic parameters during fasting, although the effects are reversed when fasting is finished.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Intermittent fasting is more effective than an ad libitum dietary intake, and equally or more effective as continuous energy restriction, for weight management. However, there is inconclusive evidence on whether intermittent fasting has a clinically beneficial effect on glucose and lipid metabolism."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Diet and circadian rhythms have been found to have a profound impact on health, disease, and aging. Skipping breakfast, eating late, and overeating have adverse effects on the body's metabolism and increase the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Disturbance of circadian rhythms has been associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other diseases. Abnormal deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) and tau proteins in the brain and impaired synaptic function are linked to cognitive dysfunction. A restrictive diet following the circadian rhythm can affect the metabolism of lipids, glucose, and amino acids such as branched chain amino acids and cysteine. These metabolic changes contribute to autophagy through molecular mechanisms such as adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), rapamycin (mTOR), D-β-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), and neuropeptide Y (NPY). Autophagy, in turn, promotes the removal of abnormally deposited proteins and damaged organelles and improves cognitive function, ultimately prolonging lifespan. In addition, a diet restricted to the circadian rhythm induces increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the forebrain region, regulating autophagy and increasing synaptic plasticity, thus enhancing cognitive function. Consequently, circadian rhythm-restricted diets could serve as a promising non-pharmacological treatment for preventing and improving cognitive dysfunction and prolonging lifespan."

      "OBJECTIVES": "Obesity is a multifactorial condition associated with metabolic alterations that can be aggravated during female aging. Calorie restriction via intermittent fasting (IF) diets may reduce body weight and therefore have the potential to decrease obesity and associated comorbidities, such as insulin resistance. This study investigated the effects of two IF protocols, alternate-day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) in middle-aged obese female rats.",
      "METHODS": "Wistar rats (age 15 mo) were fed with standard chow or high-fat diet for 8 wk and then separated into the following groups (n = 5-8 each) for another 8 wk: control (received standard chow), obese (received high-fat diet), obese + ADF (24-h fasting protocol), and obese + TRF (14 h daily).",
      "RESULTS": "At the end of the study, both IF protocols were able to reduce body weight and body mass index compared with the obese group. However, no changes were observed in adiposity and glucose homeostasis. We also found an increase in total leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes in the TRF group and a higher number of platelets in the ADF group. Blood lipid profiles, including triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein, as well as liver stress responses, such as heat shock protein 70 and malondialdehyde, were not changed by IF.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Although ADF and TRF protocols resulted in a reduction of body weight and body mass index, these dietary interventions did not promote health benefits, such as reducing blood lipid profile, adiposity, and insulin resistance. In addition, ADF and TRF increased inflammatory biomarkers, which may increase the risk of obesity-associated comorbidities."

      "SUMMARY": "The combination of ketogenic diet (KD) with intermittent fasting (IF) has, for years, aroused a great interest in the scientific world and among healthy lifestyle enthusiasts. Its importance is even greater when the study subjects are physically active individuals. The aim of the study was a determination of the effect of strict calculated ketogenic menu combined with IF and with caloric deficit on the selected biochemical markers and body composition in a 23-year-old man performing strength training. At the same time, we decided to conduct the first so-deeply investigated and controlled case study in this respect. The study protocol included a 13-week-long ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting (of delayed time-restricted eating 16:8 type) and caloric deficit. A detailed menu was designed and was used by the man throughout the whole study duration. A number of blood tests were performed before and after the implemented dietary intervention. Additionally, body composition was determined weekly and the concentrations of glucose and ketone bodies, as well as pulse rate and arterial pressure, were measured daily. The most important changes noted included a significant increase in testosterone and vitamin D concentrations and significant reduction in the HOMA-IR index and concentrations of hepatic enzymes, insulin, glucose, iron, urea, and free triiodothyronine (FT3). Moreover, a significant improvement of body composition occurred (the ratio of total body mass to the adipose and muscular tissue and water mass improved). Favourable changes were also noted in heart rate and arterial pressure values. In view of that, the KD with IF and caloric deficit exerted favourable effects on most biochemical parameters and on body composition and caused an almost twofold increase in serum testosterone concentration."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) was recently revealed to have an antiobesity impact. However, the impact and potential mechanism of high-purity IDF derived from okara (HPSIDF) on obesity caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) remain unclear. Except for dietary supplementation, intermittent fasting (IF) has attracted extensive interest as a new dietary strategy against obesity. Thus, we hypothesize that HPSIDF combined with IF treatment may be more effective in preventing obesity. In this study, HPSIDF combined with IF treatment synergistically alleviated HFD-induced dyslipidemia, impaired glucose homeostasis, systemic inflammation, and fat accumulation. Furthermore, gut microbiota dysbiosis and lowered short-chain fatty acid synthesis were recovered by HPSIDF combined with IF treatment. Meanwhile, metabolomic analysis of feces revealed that HPSIDF combined with IF treatment obviously reversed the alterations of metabolic pathways and differential metabolites induced by HFD, which were linked to the modulations of the gut microbiota. Collectively, our findings indicated that HPSIDF combined with IF treatment has great potential to substantially enhance antiobesity efficacy by modulating the gut microbiota and its metabolites."

      "SUMMARY": "The last decade has been characterized by exciting findings on eu- or hypoglycemic ketosis and ketoacidosis. This review emphasizes the following five key points: 1. Since the traditional nitroprusside-glycine dipstick test for urinary ketones is often falsely negative, the blood determination of β-hydroxybutyrate, the predominant ketone body, is currently advised for a comprehensive assessment of ketone body status; 2. Fasting and infections predispose to relevant ketosis and ketoacidosis especially in newborns, infants, children 7 years or less of age, and pregnant, parturient, or lactating women; 3. Several forms of carbohydrate restriction (typically less than 20% of the daily caloric intake) are employed to induce ketosis. These ketogenic diets have achieved great interest as antiepileptic treatment, in the management of excessive body weight, diabetes mellitus, and in sport training; 4. Intermittent fasting is more and more popular because it might benefit against cardiovascular diseases, cancers, neurologic disorders, and aging; 5. Gliflozins, a new group of oral antidiabetics inhibiting the renal sodium-glucose transporter 2, are an emerging cause of eu- or hypoglycemic ketosis and ketoacidosis. In conclusion, the role of ketone bodies is increasingly recognized in several clinical conditions. In the context of acid-base balance evaluation, it is advisable to routinely integrate both the assessment of lactic acid and β-hydroxybutyrate."

      "BACKGROUND": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary approach that limits eating to a set number of hours per day. Human studies on the effects of TRE intervention on cardiometabolic health have been contradictory. Heterogeneity in subjects and TRE interventions have led to inconsistency in results. Furthermore, the impact of the duration of eating/fasting in the TRE approach has yet to be fully explored.",
      "AIM": "To analyze the existing literature on the effects of TRE with different eating durations on anthropometrics and cardiometabolic health markers in adults with excessive weight and obesity-related metabolic diseases.",
      "METHODS": "We reviewed a series of prominent scientific databases, including Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, and Cochrane Library articles to identify published clinical trials on daily TRE in adults with excessive weight and obesity-related metabolic diseases. Randomized controlled trials were assessed for methodological rigor and risk of bias using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB-2). Outcomes of interest include body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, lean body mass, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, C-reactive protein, blood pressure, and heart rate.",
      "RESULTS": "Fifteen studies were included in our systematic review. TRE significantly reduces body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, lean body mass, blood glucose, insulin, and triglyceride. However, no significant changes were observed in HbA1c, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Furthermore, subgroup analyses based on the duration of the eating window revealed significant variation in the effects of TRE intervention depending on the length of the eating window.",
      "CONCLUSION": "TRE is a promising chrononutrition-based dietary approach for improving anthropometric and cardiometabolic health. However, further clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal eating duration in TRE intervention for cardiovascular disease prevention."

      "SUMMARY": "Switching to normal diet (ND) is the regular therapy for high-fat diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Intermittent fasting (IF) is a unique treatment which may exhibits better therapeutic efficacy. Thus, we aim to investigate the therapeutic effects of these treatments and exploring the mechanisms. In the present study, NAFLD mouse model was induced by a 10-week HFD. Thereafter, mice adopted continued HFD, ND, or IF for the next 12 weeks. Finally, the liver was then harvested to assess lipid deposition, lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and autophagy, while blood was collected to determine blood glucose and insulin. The results showed that IF and ND treatment improved lipid deposition and metabolic disorder of NAFLD mice; the increasing body weight, liver weight, and HOMA-IR index of HFD mice were also alleviated by IF and ND. Furthermore, IF and ND treatment activated the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)/AMPK pathway and regulated its downstream autophagy and apoptosis. However, the efficacy of IF was better than ND. Both IF and ND activates MIF signaling and alleviate the lipotoxicity of NAFLD while IF therapy is more effective than ND. The different MIF up-regulation might be the underlying mechanism of why IF benefits more than ND."

      "SUMMARY": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has the largest global burden of all noncommunicable diseases. Owing to the clinical heterogeneity of MetS, wide variations have been reported in the efficacy of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and intermittent fasting (IF) for improving MetS. We searched five databases for randomized controlled trials published through December 2021, and 372 participants from 11 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with MVPA alone, IF combined with MVPA had a more significant effect on improving body mass and levels of fasting blood glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; however, it was ineffective in improving triglycerides level, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Subgroup analysis showed that, except for blood pressure, time-restricted fasting combined with MVPA had a better effect than alternate-day fasting with MVPA. Meanwhile, when the intervention lasted longer than 8 weeks, the effect of the combined intervention was significantly better than that of MVPA alone. This finding provides a basis for clinicians to manage the health of overweight individuals. This study also showed that Caucasians may be more suitable for the combined intervention than Asians. And the combined intervention may provide a preventive effect for MetS risk factors in healthy populations, although this may be due to the small sample size. In general, this study provides a novel perspective on special interventions for MetS traits."

      "BACKGROUND & AIMS": "Critically ill children are fed day and night, assuming this improves enteral tolerance and the probability of achieving nutritional goals. It was previously shown that a fasting response, reflected by increased ketosis, at least partly explained the beneficial outcome of delayed initiation of supplemental parenteral nutrition. This study aims to investigate whether an overnight fast increases ketosis and is feasible and safe in critically ill children.",
      "METHODS": "The Continuousversus Intermittent Nutrition in Paediatric Intensive Care (ContInNuPIC) study is a randomised controlled trial in a tertiary referral Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in the Netherlands. Critically ill children (term newborn-18 years) with an expected PICU stay ≥48 h, dependent on artificial nutrition, were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified for age group) to intermittent feeding, with interruption of feedings during an age-dependent overnight period of eight to 12 h, or to continuous feeding, with the administration of feedings day and night. In both groups, similar daily caloric targets were pursued. For children younger than one year, mandatory minor glucose infusions were provided during fasting. The primary outcome was the feasibility, defined as two conditions (1): a significant difference in the patients' highest daily ketone (3-β-hydroxybutyrate, BHB) levels during each overnight period, and (2): non-inferiority regarding daily caloric intake, examined using a two-part mixed-effects model with a predefined non-inferiority margin of 33%, in an intention-to-treat analysis. The study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NL7877).",
      "RESULTS": "Between May 19, 2020, and July 13, 2022, 140 critically ill children, median (first quartile; third quartile) age 0.3 (0.1; 2.7) years, were randomised to intermittent (n = 67) or continuous feeding (n = 73). In the intermittent feeding group, BHB levels were significantly higher (median 0.4 (0.2; 1.0) vs. 0.3 (0.1; 0.7) mmol/L, p < 0.001). The ratio of total caloric intake in the intermittent feeding group to the intake in the continuous feeding group was not consistently significantly more than 0.67, thus not proving non-inferiority. No severe, resistant hypoglycaemic events, nor severe gastrointestinal complications related to the intervention occurred, and feeding intolerance did not occur more often in the intermittent than in the continuous feeding group.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Compared with day and night feeding, intermittent feeding with an overnight fast and mandatory glucose infusion for children younger than one year marginally increased ketosis and did not lead to more hypoglycaemic incidents in critically ill children. Because non-inferiority regarding daily caloric intake was not proven, the feasibility of an overnight fast could not be shown in the current study. However, as feeding intolerance did not increase during the condensed feeding periods, the nutritional intake was probably limited by the prescription of nutrition and interruptions. More research is needed to determine the optimal level and duration of clinically relevant ketosis and the best method to achieve this."

After 6 wk of experimental periods, an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. One week later, phosphate-buffered saline or a glucose and branched-chain amino acid mixture was administered orally, and blood and tissues were collected 30 min later.",
      "RESULTS": "The oral glucose tolerance test results revealed that the IF group had better insulin sensitivity. They also had lower body and fat weights while maintaining the same level of skeletal muscle mass as the ad libitum group. The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in the skeletal muscle, a marker for the activation of protein translation, was greater in the IF group after glucose and branched-chain amino acid mixture administration. Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II-to-light chain 3-I ratio, a marker for autophagosome formation, in skeletal muscle during fasting was significantly lower in the IF group than that in the ad libitum group.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "Our findings suggest that adaptation to IF regulates protein synthesis and breakdown, leading to the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass while reducing body fat."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is a diet with salutary effects on cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke. IF restricts a number of nutrient components, including glucose. 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a glucose analog, can be used to mimic glucose restriction. 2-DG induced transcription of the pro-plasticity factor, Bdnf, in the brain without ketosis. Accordingly, 2-DG enhanced memory in an AD model (5xFAD) and functional recovery in an ischemic stroke model. 2-DG increased Bdnf transcription via reduced N-linked glycosylation, consequent ER stress, and activity of ATF4 at an enhancer of the Bdnf gene, as well as other regulatory regions of plasticity/regeneration (e.g., Creb5, Cdc42bpa, Ppp3cc, and Atf3) genes. These findings demonstrate an unrecognized role for N-linked glycosylation as an adaptive sensor to reduced glucose availability. They further demonstrate that ER stress induced by 2-DG can, in the absence of ketosis, lead to the transcription of genes involved in plasticity and cognitive resilience as well as proteostasis."

In this study, we employed the event-related potential (ERP) electroencephalography technique to investigate the effect of CHO mouth rinsing on electrophysiological correlates of visuospatial attention. Using a double-blind, non-nutritive sweetener (NNS)-controlled, within-subjects design, 53 young adults performed a standard cognitive task (modified Simon task) on two separate days in a fasted state (16 h).

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Aging and obesity are the two prominent driving forces of metabolic dysfunction, yet the common underlying mechanisms remain elusive. PPARγ, a central metabolic regulator and primary drug target combatting insulin resistance, is hyperacetylated in both aging and obesity. By employing a unique adipocyte-specific PPARγ acetylation-mimetic mutant knock-in mouse model, namely aKQ, we demonstrate that these mice develop worsened obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance as they age, and these metabolic deregulations are resistant to intervention by intermittent fasting. Interestingly, aKQ mice show a whitening phenotype of brown adipose tissue (BAT) manifested in lipid filling and suppressed BAT markers. Diet-induced obese aKQ mice retain an expected response to thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment, while BAT function remains impaired. This BAT whitening phenotype persists even with the activation of SirT1 through resveratrol treatment. Moreover, the adverse effect of TZDs on bone loss is exacerbated in aKQ mice and is potentially mediated by their increased Adipsin levels. Our results collectively suggest pathogenic implications of adipocyte PPARγ acetylation, contributing to metabolic dysfunction in aging and thus posing as a potential therapeutic target."

    "title": "Is breakfast consumption detrimental, unnecessary, or an opportunity for health promotion? A review of cardiometabolic outcomes and functional food choices.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Breakfast consumption is generally considered a health-promoting habit for cardiometabolism, particularly with regard to chrononutrition. Glucose uptake is enhanced by proper insulin secretion triggered by the pancreatic clock, averting metabolic dysregulation related to insulin resistance. Breakfast skipping, in turn, is often considered a behaviour detrimental to health, in part due to putative inverse metabolic actions compared to breakfast consumption, such that breakfast skipping may promote circadian desynchrony. However, most ill health concerns about breakfast skipping are inferred from observational research, and recent well-controlled randomized clinical trials have shown benefits of breakfast skipping for cardiovascular risk factors. Accordingly, this review describes the effects of breakfast consumption versus breakfast skipping on cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and glycaemic and lipid indices). In addition, the view of breakfast consumption as an opportunity for functional food ingestion is considered to provide further insights into decision-making practice. Collectively, both breakfast consumption and breakfast skipping can be considered viable habits, but they depend on individual preferences, planning, and the specific foods being consumed or omitted. When consumed, breakfast should consist primarily of functional foods typical for this meal (e.g., eggs, dairy products, nuts, fruits, whole grains, coffee, tea, etc.). While breakfast consumption aligns with chrononutrition principles, breakfast skipping can contribute to a calorie deficit over time, which has the potential for widespread cardiometabolic benefits for patients with overweight/obesity. The concepts and practical considerations discussed in the present review may aid health care personnel in personalising breakfast consumption recommendations for diverse patient populations."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "To explore the mechanism by which intermittent fasting (IF) exerts prolonged effects after discontinuation, we examined mice that had been subjected to 4 cycles of fasting for 72 hours and ad libitum feeding for 96 hours per week (72hIF), followed by 4 weeks of ad libitum feeding, focusing on expression of genes for lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscle and histone acetylation in the promoter region. The 72hIF regimen resulted in metabolic remodeling, characterized by enhanced lipid utilization and mitochondrial activation in the muscle. This long-term IF (72hIF) caused stronger metabolic effects than alternate day fasting (24hIF) wherein fasting and refeeding are repeated every 24 hours. Upregulation of lipid oxidation genes and an increase in oxygen utilization were sustained even at 4 weeks after discontinuation of 72hIF, associated with histone hyperacetylation of the promoter region of uncoupling protein 3 ("

    "title": "Neurotrophic effects of intermittent fasting, calorie restriction and exercise: a review and annotated bibliography.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "In the last decades, important progress has been achieved in the understanding of the neurotrophic effects of intermittent fasting (IF), calorie restriction (CR) and exercise. Improved neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis (NSPAN) are essential examples of these neurotrophic effects. The importance in this respect of the metabolic switch from glucose to ketone bodies as cellular fuel has been highlighted. More recently, calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs; resveratrol and other polyphenols in particular) have been investigated thoroughly in relation to NSPAN. In the narrative review sections of this manuscript, recent findings on these essential functions are synthesized and the most important molecules involved are presented. The most researched signaling pathways (PI3K, Akt, mTOR, AMPK, GSK3β, ULK, MAPK, PGC-1α, NF-κB, sirtuins, Notch, Sonic hedgehog and Wnt) and processes (e.g., anti-inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis) that support or thwart neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis are then briefly presented. This provides an accessible entry point to the literature. In the annotated bibliography section of this contribution, brief summaries are provided of about 30 literature reviews relating to the neurotrophic effects of interest in relation to IF, CR, CRMs and exercise. Most of the selected reviews address these essential functions from the perspective of healthier aging (sometimes discussing epigenetic factors) and the reduction of the risk for neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease) and depression or the improvement of cognitive function."

      "OBJECTIVES": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary intervention that may offer some protection against cardiovascular disease (CVD), while also preserving performance in athletes. To date however, research on TRE in an active population has only been conducted in college-age cohorts and the effects of TRE in an older, trained population are less understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of a 4-wk, 16:8 TRE intervention on markers of CVD risk in middle-age, male cyclists.",
      "METHODS": "Participants (N = 12; age, 51.9 ± 8.6 y; training duration/wk, 375 ± 140 min; peak aerobic capacity, 41.8 ± 5.6 mL/kg/min) reported to the laboratory for two sessions (i.e., at baseline and post-TRE) where blood was drawn from an antecubital vein after an 8-h overnight fast. Dependent variables measured at baseline and post-TRE included insulin, cortisol, brain-derived neurotropic factor, free testosterone, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, C-reactive protein, advanced oxidative protein products, glutathione, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, glucose, and a full lipid profile.",
      "RESULTS": "Compared with baseline, TRE significantly lowered TNF-α (12.3 ± 3.4 versus 9.2 ± 2.4 pg/mL; P = 0.02) and glucose concentrations (93.4 ± 9.7 versus 87.5 ± 7.9 mg/dL; P = 0.01), as well as significantly elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (45.7 ± 13.7 versus 49.2 ± 12.3 mg/dL; P = 0.04), respectively. No further significant changes were observed between the remaining variables (all P > 0.05).",
      "CONCLUSION": "Overall, these data suggest that incorporating a 4-wk TRE intervention with habitual endurance training can significantly improve some markers of CVD risk and may compliment the robust health benefits derived from a regular exercise regimen."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "In 1991 the U.S. Congress mandated that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) form the Office of Alternative Medicine to study alternative medical therapies, especially in oncology care. Shortly after, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) created its own division of complementary and alternative medicine (Office of Complementary and Alternative Medicine). At the genesis of the field 30 years ago, what were we hoping to see accomplished by now? In this article we take a look back at milestones, shortfalls and future directions. Exciting opportunities exist to direct our established subspeciality's future directions and we have made valuable advances the field of integrative oncology over the last 30 years: 1, IV high dose ascorbate has clinical research-based applications when used concurrently with some chemotherapeutic agents. 2. Whole body, extracorporeal and locoregional hyperthermia are being applied in treating solid tumors, including brain tumors. 3. PDL-1 tumor microenvironment testing and PDL-1 inhibitor immunotherapies have surprisingly excellent outcomes in a subgroup of cancer patients. 4. Tumor DNA sequencing (resected tumor and circulating tumor DNA in blood) has led to personalized precision targeted treatments. 5. Glucose metabolism's role in cancer progression is better understood and better therapies are available (e.g., intermittent fasting, metformin). 6. Medical cannabis has a larger role in treating chemotherapy-related side effects and shows promise for anti-proliferative effects. 8. Greater understanding has been gained of the interdependence and mutual regulation of processes in psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (PNEI). The burgeoning field of PNEI has exponentially expanded the discussion of tumorigenesis, apoptosis, and introduced to the field the investigation of more holistic approaches to immune regulation and cancer care. 8. Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is gaining traction especially for cancer patients facing demoralization, existential and spiritual distress, anxiety, depression and trauma related to the diagnosis and treatment of their cancer. 9. Spiritual health of cancer patients is more commonly addressed and measurable with an NIH validated scale. 10. Mind-Body therapies are efficacious for reducing cancer-related distress and are included in many cancer care programs."

    "abstract": {
      "OBJECTIVE": "A healthy diet is a modifiable risk factor that may impact cognition. A unique type of diet may include intermittent fasting (IF), an eating pattern in which individuals go extended periods with little or no meal intake, intervening with periods of normal food intake. IF has multiple health benefits including maintenance of blood glucose levels, reduction of insulin levels, depletion or reduction of glycogen stores, mobilization of fatty acids, and generation of ketones. IF has shown neuroprotective effects as it may lead to increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which may contribute to cognitive resilience. Diets including IF were examined as lifestyle modifications in the prevention and management of cognitive decline.",
      "METHODS": "A systematic literature search was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which assessed the effect of dieting on cognitive functions in adults.",
      "RESULTS": "Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), low-glycemic diets, and caloric restriction have shown improvement in cognitive function; however, there was a negative impact on problem-solving in those with comorbid cardiovascular disease. There is also contradictory evidence that caloric restriction and diet alone may not be sufficient for the improvement of cognitive functions and that exercise may have better efficacy on cognition.",
      "CONCLUSION": "IF is considered a safe intervention, and no adverse effects were found in the reviewed studies; however, evidence is limited as there were only 9 low-quality RCTs that assessed the impact of IF on cognition. DASH, low-glycemic diets, and exercise may have effective roles in the management and prevention of cognitive decline, although further research is needed."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is the practice of temporal food restriction to promote metabolic switching between a glucose- and a ketone-based metabolism, which has been reported to come with diverse health benefits. IF practices appear to confer many of the advantages of caloric restriction without restricting total energy intake, and studies in both rodents and humans suggest organism-wide improvements in neurological, cardiovascular and metabolic health. IF is also commonly employed in the commercial rearing of breeding meat-type poultry, i.e. broiler breeders, which require strict feed restriction throughout life to maintain physical health. While the scientific poultry literature holds vast amounts of data on such \"skip-a-day\" feeding schedules, it has been unclear to what extent avian and mammalian literature may be compared as broiler breeders are typically feed-restricted to around 30% of ad libitum intake even in IF schedules. In this study, we set out to disentangle the effects of IF and caloric restriction in meat-type poultry by employing both IF and daily feeding schedules at two different restriction levels. Our results suggest that the physiological response to IF in chickens is only marginally affected by the intensity of feed restriction, while behavioural parameters are more closely related to feeding level and are expected to better mirror animal welfare. Our results suggest that avian and mammalian literature on IF should be comparable. Meat-type chickens do show some peculiarities in response to IF, such as a reduced insulin sensitivity, but it is currently unclear whether this is true for all chickens or is an effect of the intense selection for rapid growth in meat-type chickens."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Whilst the treatment and prevention of overweight and obesity-related disease is managed by restricting daily energy intake, long-term adherence to dietary strategies appears unsustainable. Time-restricted eating (TRE) aims to position energy intake in an eating window under 12 h per day and offers an alternative behavioral intervention, which can aid weight management and improve cardiometabolic health. Adherence to previous TRE protocols is estimated at between 63 and 100%, although the accuracy of reporting is unclear. This study therefore aimed to provide an objective, subjective, and qualitative overview of adherence to a prescribed TRE protocol, and to identify any potential barriers affecting adherence. Adherence after 5 weeks of TRE was estimated at ~63% based on continuous glucose monitoring data when compared with time-stamped diet diaries. Subjective participant responses reported adherence at an average of ~61% per week. Barriers to adopting TRE, including work schedules, social events, and family life, were identified by participants during qualitative interviews. The findings of this study suggest that the development of personalized TRE protocols may help to navigate the barriers to adherence leading to improved health-related outcomes."

To construct the FA model, all mice were sensitized and intragastrical challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) during the second half of IF (day 28 to day 56). Rectal temperature reduction and diarrhea were recorded to evaluate the symptoms of FA. Levels of serum IgE, IgG1, Th1/Th2 cytokines, mRNA expression of spleen T cell related transcriptional factors, and cytokines were examined. H&E, immunofluorescence, and toluidine blue staining were used to assess the structural changes of ileum villi. The composition and abundance of gut microbiota were analyzed by 16srRNA sequencing in cecum feces.",
      "RESULTS": "The diarrhea score and rectal temperature reduction were lower in the two fasting groups compared to the FrD groups. Fasting was associated with lower levels of serum OVA-sIgE, OVA-sIgG1, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5, and mRNA expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 in the spleen. While no significant association was observed in interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, IL-2 levels. Less mast cell infiltration in ileum was observed in the 16h/8h fasting group compared to the FrD group. ZO-1 expression in the ileum of the two fasting groups was higher in IF mice.

    "title": "\"Effect of time-restricted feeding on high-fat diet-induced metabolic dysfunction in Drosophila melanogaster\".",
    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Metabolic alterations associated with obesity have been related to chronodisruption i.e., the desynchronization of molecular clocks that regulate circadian rhythms. The search for tools that improve the dietary treatment of obesity has recently focused on behaviors related to chronodisruption, and intermittent fasting is increasingly gaining interest. Studies in animal models have identified the benefits of time-restricted feeding (TRF) on metabolic alterations associated with changes in circadian rhythms induced by a high-fat diet. We aimed to evaluate the effect of TRF in flies with metabolic damage and chronodisruption.",
      "METHODS": "Using high-fat diet fed Drosophila melanogaster as a model of metabolic damage and chronodisruption, we determined the impact of 12-h TRF on metabolic and molecular markers. Flies with metabolic dysfunction were switched to a control diet and randomly assigned to Ad libitum or a TRF regimen for seven days. We evaluated total triglyceride content, glycemia, weight, and 24 h mRNA expression rhythms of Nlaz (insulin resistance marker), clock genes (circadian rhythm molecular markers), and the neuropeptide Cch-amide2.",
      "RESULTS": "Flies with metabolic damage that received TRF showed lower total triglyceride content, Nlaz expression, circulating glucose, and weight compared to Ad libitum. We observed the recovery of some of the high-fat diet-induced alterations in the amplitude of the circadian rhythm, particularly in the peripheral clock.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "TRF produced a partial reversal of metabolic dysfunction and chronodisruption of circadian cycles.",
      "GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE": "TRF could be a useful tool to help to ameliorate metabolic and chronobiologic damage induced by a high-fat diet."

      "BACKGROUND": "Some patients with herpes zoster (HZ) experience an intermittent spontaneous, short-lived and severe pain, which is called breakthrough pain (BTP). The effect of analgesic drugs and invasive procedures is not significant. Therefore, treatment of HZ associated with BTP is challenging. Esketamine is a new N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, with enhanced analgesic effects. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse reactions of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with low-dose esketamine for HZ associated with BTP.",
      "OBJECTIVES": "To evaluate the efficacy and adverse reactions of PCIA with low-dose esketamine for HZ associated with BTP.",
      "STUDY DESIGN": "A retrospective, observational study.",
      "SETTING": "The study was carried out in the Pain Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University in Jiaxing, China.",
      "METHODS": "The clinical data of HZ associated with BTP treated by PCIA with low-dose esketamine at the Pain Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, between October 2015 to October 2021, were collected retrospectively. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) scores of rest pain (RP) and BTP, frequency of BTP, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were recorded and analyzed before treatment (T0) and on days one (T1) and 3 (T2), week one (T3), months one (T4), 3 (T5), and 6 (T6) after treatment. Adverse reactions during the treatment were recorded.",
      "RESULTS": "Twenty-five patients treated by PCIA with low-dose esketamine were included finally. Compared with T0, the NRS-11 scores of RP at T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6 decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The NRS-11 score of RP at T4 was significantly lower than that of T3 (P < 0.001), but there was no statistical difference between T5 and T4 (P > 0.05), the efficacy of esketamine in the treatment of RP was stable at one month after treatment. Likewise, compared with T0, the NRS-11 scores of BTP, frequency of BTP, and PSQI score decreased significantly at each time point after treatment (P < 0.05). These at T5 were significantly lower than T4 (P < 0.05), but there was no statistical difference between T6 and T5 (P > 0.05), the efficacy of esketamine was stable at 3 months after treatment. FBG also decreased significantly at each time point after treatment (P < 0.05), it tended to be normal and stable one month after treatment. All patients had mild symptoms of dizziness during treatment, and though a slight increase in noninvasive blood pressure (BP) was noted in all, the elevated BP did not exceed 30% of the baseline value. Four patients (16%) developed nausea without vomiting. There were no serious adverse reactions, such as respiratory depression.",
      "LIMITATIONS": "The nonrandomized, single-center, small sample size, retrospective design is a major limitation of this study.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "PCIA with low-dose esketamine has a significant and long-term effect in the treatment of HZ associated with BTP. The RP was controlled, and the degree and frequency of BTP were significantly reduced after treatment, leading to improved quality of life. There were no serious adverse reactions worthy of clinical promotion."

      "SUMMARY": "Fasting is associated with increased susceptibility to hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes, thereby making it a significant health risk. To date, the relationship between fasting and insulin-induced hypoglycemia has not been well characterized, so our objective was to determine whether insulin-independent factors, such as counterregulatory hormone responses, are adversely impacted by fasting in healthy control individuals. Counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were measured in 12 healthy people during 2 metabolic studies. During one study, participants ate breakfast and lunch, after which they underwent a 2-hour bout of insulin-induced hypoglycemia (FED). During the other study, participants remained fasted prior to hypoglycemia (FAST). As expected, hepatic glycogen concentrations were lower in FAST, and associated with diminished peak glucagon levels and reduced endogenous glucose production (EGP) during hypoglycemia. Accompanying lower EGP in FAST was a reduction in peripheral glucose utilization, and a resultant reduction in the amount of exogenous glucose required to maintain glycemia. These data suggest that whereas a fasting-induced lowering of glucose utilization could potentially delay the onset of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, subsequent reductions in glucagon levels and EGP are likely to encumber recovery from it. As a result of this diminished metabolic flexibility in response to fasting, susceptibility to hypoglycemia could be enhanced in patients with type 1 diabetes under similar conditions."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an ecological strategy to control various metabolic disorder symptoms, but its protective effect on type 1 diabetes (T1D)-induced cognitive dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Herein, we examined the efficacy of IF in altering the behaviors and brain metabolome in T1D mice and investigated the potential molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that IF remarkably improved frontal cortical-dependent memory in T1D mice and reduced the loss of neuronal cells. Metabolomics and targeted mass spectrometry assays showed that IF reprogrammed the composition of the frontal cortical metabolome in T1D mice, including activating the aspartate and glutamate pathway and reversing glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid depositions. Mechanistically, IF attenuated the levels of oxidative stress proteins, like NOX2, NOX4, 8-OHdG, and 4-HNE, and inhibited the levels of pro-apoptotic factors Bax and cleaved Caspase-3, ultimately improving the memory ability of T1D mice. In vitro studies confirmed the protective effect of the supplemented N-acetylaspartate, a pivotal metabolite involved in IF-regulated T1D-induced cognitive dysfunction, in high glucose-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells by eliminating toxic lipids accumulation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. To conclude, the frontal cortical metabolites mediated the protective effects of IF against T1D-induced cognitive dysfunction by attenuating oxidative stress and apoptotic signaling. Thus, IF can be a potential therapeutic strategy for T1D-induced cognitive dysfunction."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia without effective clinical treatment. Here, we show that intermittent fasting (IF) improves cognitive functions and AD-like pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model (5XFAD). IF alters gut microbial composition with a significant enrichment in probiotics such as Lactobacillus. The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota affect metabolic activities and metabolite production. Metabolomic profiling analysis of cecal contents revealed IF leads to a decreased carbohydrate metabolism (for example, glucose) and an increased abundance in amino acids (for example, sarcosine and dimethylglycine). Interestingly, we found that the administration of IF-elevated sarcosine or dimethylglycine mimics the protective effects of IF in 5XFAD mice, including the amelioration of cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) burden and glial overactivation. Our findings thus demonstrate an IF regimen is a potential approach to prevent AD progression, at least through the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis, and constitutes an innovative AD therapeutic avenue."

      "SUMMARY": "NASH is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease with the potential of evolving towards end-stage liver disease and HCC, even in the absence of cirrhosis. Apart from becoming an increasingly prevalent indication for liver transplantation in cirrhotic and HCC patients, its burden on the healthcare system is also exerted by the increased number of noncirrhotic NASH patients. Intermittent fasting has recently gained more interest in the scientific community as a possible treatment approach for different components of metabolic syndrome. Basic science and clinical studies have shown that apart from inducing body weight loss, improving cardiometabolic parameters, namely blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels; insulin and glucose metabolism; intermittent fasting can reduce inflammatory markers, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, autophagy, and endothelial dysfunction, as well as modulate gut microbiota. This review aims to further explore the main NASH pathogenetic metabolic drivers on which intermittent fasting can act upon and improve the prognosis of the disease, and summarize the current clinical evidence."

      "SUMMARY": "To investigate the effects of different weight loss interventions on body mass index (BMI) and glucose and lipid metabolism in obese patients. Obese patients (n = 135) admitted to our hospital between December 2020 and August 2022 were divided into 3 groups, according to their diet patterns: calorie-restricted diet (CRD) group (n = 39), high-protein diet (HPD) group (n = 28), and 5 + 2 intermittent fasting (IF) group (n = 68). Body weight, body fat rate, BMI, hip circumference, and waist circumference were measured before and 60 days after implementation of the respective diet plan. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2h postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and adverse events were evaluated. Following the dietary intervention, the weight (P = .005 for CRD, P < .001 for HPD, and P = .001 for IF), body fat rate (P = .027 for CRD, P = .002 for HPD, and P = .011 for IF group), BMI (P = .017 for CRD, P < .001 for HPD, and P = .002 for IF group), hip circumference (P < .001 for CRD, P = .013 for HPD, and P = .032 for IF group), waist circumference (P = .005 for CRD, P < .001 for HPD, and P = .028 for IF group), HbA1c (P = .014 for CRD, P = .002 for HPD, and P = .029 for IF group), FBG (P = .017 for CRD, P < .001 for HPD, and P = .033 for IF group), and 2hPG (P = .009 for CRD, P = .001 for HPD, and P = .012 for IF group), were significantly decreased. TG (P = .007 for CRD, P < .001 for HPD, and P = .018 for IF group), TC (P = .029 for CRD, P = .013 for HPD, and P = .041 for IF group), LDL-C (P = .033 for CRD, P = .021 for HPD, and P = .042 for IF group), and LDL-C (P = .011 for CRD, P < .001 for HPD, and P = .027 for IF group) improved significantly in the 3 groups, when compared to that before treatment. The HPD had the best effect on reducing blood lipids, followed by the CRD; the effect of IF was slightly lesser. Short-term HPD, CRD, and IF can reduce the weight and body fat of overweight/obese individuals and improve blood lipid and blood sugar levels. The effect of HPD on weight loss, body fat, and blood lipid levels was greater than that of CRD or IF."

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Acromegaly diagnosis is established when plasma levels of IGF-1 are increased and the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with 75gr of glucose can't suppress Growth Hormone (GH) levels. These two parameters are also useful during follow-up, after surgical/radiologic therapy and/or during medical therapy.",
      "CASE PRESENTATION": "A 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with acromegaly after a severe headache. Previous amenorrhea and facial and acral changes were noticed. A pituitary macroadenoma was found, biochemical evaluation was in agreement with the suspected acromegaly and a transsphenoidal adenectomy was performed. As the disease recurred, a surgical reintervention and radiosurgery (Gamma Knife, 22 Gy) were necessary. No normalization of IGF-1 was achieved during three years after radiosurgery. Surprisingly, then, and although clinical features seemed getting worse, IGF-1 levels became consistently controlled to 0.3-0.8 times the upper limit of the reference range. Questioned, the patient referred that she was following an intermittent fasting dietary plan. However, based on the dietary questionnaire, she was found to be under severe caloric restriction. First OGTT (under caloric restriction) showed absence of GH suppression and an IGF-1 value of 234 ng/dL (Reference Range 76-286 ng/mL). A second OGTT, one month after an eucaloric diet was instituted, showed an increased IGF-1 of 294 ng/dL, maintaining an unsuppressed, yet less elevated, GH.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "GHRH/GH/IGF-1 axis controls somatic growth. Regulation is complex, and nutrition status and feeding pattern have a recognized role. Like systemic inflammation or chronic liver disease, fasting and malnutrition decrease the expression of hepatic GH receptors, with consequent reduction of IGF-1 levels, through resistance to GH. This clinical report shows that caloric restriction may represent a pitfall in acromegaly follow-up."

      "METHODS": "After screening, 28 studies were included in this systematic review.",
      "RESULTS": "In addition to weight loss, IF could benefit health subjects by strengthening their circadian rhythms, migrating immune cells, lower inflammatory factors, and enriching microbials. In addition of the anti-inflammatory effect by regulating macrophages, protection against oxidative stress with hormone secretion and oxidative-related gene expression plays a key beneficial role for the influence of IF on obese subjects.",
      "DISCUSSION": "Physiological stress by surgery and pathophysiological disorders by endocrine diseases may be partly eased with IF. Moreover, IF might be used to treat anxiety and cognitive disorders with its cellular, metabolic and circadian mechanisms. Finally, the specific effects of IF and the mechanisms pertaining to immune system in these conditions require additional studies."

      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern in which individuals go extended periods with little or no energy intake after consuming regular food in intervening periods. IF has several health-promoting effects. It can effectively reduce weight, fasting insulin levels, and blood glucose levels. It can also increase the antitumor activity of medicines and cause improvement in the case of neurological diseases, such as memory deficit, to achieve enhanced metabolic function and prolonged longevity. Additionally, IF activates several biological pathways to induce autophagy, encourages cell renewal, prevents cancer cells from multiplying and spreading, and delays senescence. However, IF has specific adverse effects and limitations when it comes to people of a particular age and gender. Hence, a more systematic study on the health-promoting effects and safety of IF is needed. This article reviewed the research on the health-promoting effects of IF, providing a theoretical basis, direction for subsequent basic research, and information related to the clinical application of IF."

      "SUMMARY": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a heterogeneous condition associated with increased cardiovascular risk. There is growing evidence from experimental, translational, and clinical investigations that has suggested that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with prevalent and incident components of MS and MS itself. The biological plausibility is supportive, primarily related to one of the main features of OSA, namely intermittent hypoxia: increased sympathetic activation with hemodynamic repercussions, increased hepatic glucose output, insulin resistance through adipose tissue inflammation, pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, hyperlipidemia through the worsening of fasting lipid profiles, and the reduced clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Although there are multiple related pathways, the clinical evidence relies mainly on cross-sectional data preventing any causality assumptions. The overlapping presence of visceral obesity or other confounders such as medications challenges the ability to understand the independent contribution of OSA on MS. In this review, we revisit the evidence on how OSA/intermittent hypoxia could mediate adverse effects of MS parameters independent of adiposity. Particular attention is devoted to discussing recent evidence from interventional studies. This review describes the research gaps, the challenges in the field, perspectives, and the need for additional high-quality data from interventional studies addressing the impact of not only established but promising therapies for OSA/obesity."

      "SUMMARY": "The metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting (IF) have been well recognized. However, limited studies have examined the relationship between long-term maternal IF before pregnancy and offspring health. In this study, a C57BL/6J mouse model of long-term IF before pregnancy was established: 4-week-old female mice were subjected to alternate-day fasting for 12 weeks and resumed normal diet after mating. Female mice in the control group were fed ad libitum. Offspring mice were weaned at 6 weeks of age and fed a normal chow diet or a 60% high-fat diet. The effects of long-term pre-pregnancy IF on offspring metabolism and its underlying mechanism were examined. We found that neonatal IF offspring weighted significantly less relevant to control mice. This difference gradually disappeared as a result of catch-up growth. In the IF offspring, adipose tissue mass was significantly increased. This alteration was associated with a considerable deterioration in glucose tolerance. No significant difference in food intake was observed. Further, lipid deposition as well as triglyceride contents in the liver were greatly increased. Maternal IF significantly decreased levels of DNA methyltransferase in the liver of offspring. DNA methylation modifications of molecules associated with the mTORC1 signaling pathway were significantly altered, leading to the significant inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Overexpression of S6K1 activated hepatic mTORC1 signaling and reversed the metabolic dysfunction in IF offspring. In conclusion, long-term pre-pregnancy IF increases hepatic steatosis and adiposity, as well as impairs glucose metabolism in adult offspring. This occurs through DNA methylation-dependent suppression of hepatic mTORC1 signaling activity."

Our objective was to examine the effect of time-restricted eating (TRE) on cardiometabolic health. Using a cross-over study design, 15 endurance-trained male runners were randomized to either a normal dietary pattern (ND) first (12 h eating/fasting times) followed by time-restricted eating (TRE) pattern (16 h fast; 8 h eating) or the reverse, with a 4-week washout period between interventions. Body composition, resting energy expenditure, blood pressure and serum insulin, glucose and lipids were measured using standard laboratory methods. Exercise training and dietary intake (calories and macronutrients) were similar across interventions. No significant differences were observed in resting energy expenditure, markers of insulin resistance, serum lipids or blood pressure. Body composition did change significantly ("

      "SUMMARY": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most-frequent malignancy amongst women, whereas obesity and excess caloric consumption increase the risk for developing the disease. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the impact of intermittent fasting (IF) on previously diagnosed BC patients, regarding quality of life (QoL) scores during chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced toxicity, radiological response and BC recurrence, endocrine-related outcomes, as well as IF-induced adverse effects in these populations. A comprehensive search was conducted between 31 December 2010 and 31 October 2022, using the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Two investigators independently performed abstract screenings, full-text screenings, and data extraction, and the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies. We screened 468 papers, 10 of which were selected for data synthesis. All patients were female adults whose age ranged between 27 and 78 years. Participants in all studies were women diagnosed with BC of one of the following stages: I, II (HER2-/+), III (HER2-/+), IV, LUMINAL-A, LUMINAL-B (HER2-/+). Notably, IF during chemotherapy was found to be feasible, safe and able to relieve chemotherapy-induced adverse effects and cytotoxicity. IF seemed to improve QoL during chemotherapy, through the reduction of fatigue, nausea and headaches, however data were characterized as low quality. IF was found to reduce chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and augmented optimal glycemic regulation, improving serum glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 concentrations. A remarkable heterogeneity of duration of dietary patterns was observed among available studies. In conclusion, we failed to identify any IF-related beneficial effects on the QoL, response after chemotherapy or related symptoms, as well as measures of tumor recurrence in BC patients. We identified a potential beneficial effect of IF on chemotherapy-induced toxicity, based on markers of DNA and leukocyte damage; however, these results were derived from three studies and require further validation. Further studies with appropriate design and larger sample sizes are warranted to elucidate its potential standard incorporation in daily clinical practice."

We aim to elucidate the effect of long-term intermittent fasting (IF) before pregnancy on health outcomes of offspring. Here we show long-term IF before pregnancy disrupts intestinal homeostasis of offspring with subsequent disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism. This occurs through the reduction in beneficial microbiota such as Lactobacillus_intestinalis. Our observations further support the concept that intestinal microbiota in offspring is vulnerable to maternal nutrition, and its homeostasis is critical for the integrity of intestinal barrier and metabolic homeostasis."

      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting and exercise provide neuroprotection from age-related cognitive decline. A link between these two seemingly distinct stressors is their capability to steer the brain away from exclusively glucose metabolism. This cerebral substrate switch has been implicated in upregulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein involved in neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and may underlie some of these neuroprotective effects. We examined the isolated and interactive effects of (1) 20-h fasting, (2) 90-min light exercise, and (3) high-intensity exercise on peripheral venous BDNF in 12 human volunteers. A follow-up study isolated the influence of cerebrovascular shear stress on circulating BDNF. Fasting for 20 h decreased glucose and increased ketones (P ≤ 0.0157) but had no effect on BDNF (P ≥ 0.4637). Light cycling at 25% of peak oxygen uptake ( "

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) haploinsufficiency (acute intermittent porphyria, AIP) is characterized by neurovisceral attacks associated with high production, accumulation and urinary excretion of heme precursors, δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). The estimated clinical penetrance for AIP is extremely low (<1%), therefore it is likely that other factors may play an important role in the predisposition to developing attacks. Fasting is a known triggering factor. Given the increased prevalence of insulin resistance in patients and the large urinary loss of succinyl-CoA to produce ALA and PBG, we explore the impact of reduced availability of energy metabolites in the severity of AIP pathophysiology. Classic studies found clinical improvement in patients affected by AIP associated with the administration of glucose and concomitant insulin secretion, or after hyperinsulinemia associated with diabetes. Molecular studies have confirmed that glucose and insulin administration induces a repressive effect on hepatic ALA Synthase, the first and regulatory step of the heme pathway. More recently, the insulin-mimicking α-lipoic acid has been shown to improve glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in a hepatocyte cell line transfected with interfering RNA targeting PBGD. In AIP mice, preventive treatment with an experimental fusion protein of insulin and apolipoprotein A-I improved the disease by promoting fat mobilization in adipose tissue, increasing the metabolite bioavailability for the TCA cycle and inducing mitochondrial biogenesis in the liver. In this review, we analyze the possible mechanisms underlying abnormal hepatocellular carbohydrate homeostasis in AIP."

      "SUMMARY": "Akute Porphyrien beruhen auf seltenen hereditären Störungen der hepatischen Hämbiosynthese. Akkumulierende neurotoxische Metaboliten führen schubartig zu multisystemischen Symptomen wie viszeralen Schmerzen, vegetativer Dysregulation, neurokognitiven Defiziten, Hyponatriämien und im Verlauf motorischen Lähmungen. Neben protrahierten Manifestationen ohne Notfallcharakter können akute lebensbedrohliche Krisen auftreten, oft getriggert durch Infektionen, Medikamente, Fastenperioden oder hormonelle Stimuli. Das klinische Bild ist unspezifisch und vielgestaltig; viele Patienten haben eine längere Odyssee hinter sich. Akute Attacken führen häufig dazu, dass Patienten zuerst in der Notaufnahme vorstellig werden, wo die akute hepatische Porphyrie (AHP) oft als Differenzialdiagnose des akuten diffusen Bauchschmerzes nicht bedacht wird. Für die Diagnosestellung bedarf es eines genuinen differenzialdiagnostischen Anfangsverdachts (z. B. Cluster von Anzeichen und Symptomen sowie ggf. gewisse Muster der Inanspruchnahme von Gesundheitsleistungen). Die Diagnostik erfolgt initial über die Metabolitenbestimmung im Urin. Das Notfallmanagement besteht aus Infusionen von Glukose und Hämarginat sowie symptomatischer Therapie. Hierbei müssen porphyrinogene Wirkstoffe vermieden werden ( www.drugs-porphyria.org ). Im Verlauf sind eine gründliche Aufarbeitung an einem Porphyriezentrum (Diagnosesicherung, Beratung) und das Erstellen eines Notfallausweises notwendig. Bei hoher Schubfrequenz kommen neue gezielte prophylaktische Therapien in Betracht. Patienten mit bekannter Porphyrie bedürfen auch in anderweitigen Notfallsituationen besonderer akutmedizinischer Fürsorge, um porphyrinogene Trigger für die Auslösung einer Krise zu erkennen und zu vermeiden und bedrohliche Differenzialdiagnosen (z. B. Sepsis) auszuschließen."

      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES": "Evidence showed that intermittent fasting may have beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome. However, the results are controversial and indefinite. This study intends to investigate and assess the effects of intermittent fasting (IF) on cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome.",
      "METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN": "We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to July 31, 2022. Primary outcomes included body mass index, fat mass, fat free mass, body weight, blood pressure, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (IR), fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and lipid profiles.",
      "RESULTS": "Of 4997 retrieved records, 6 met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that IF can significantly reduce BMI (mean difference=-1.56 kg/m2, 95% CI: -2.62 to -0.51), fat mass (mean difference=-1.35%, 95% CI: -2.03 to -0.67), fat free mass (mean difference=-0.63%, 95% CI: -1.22 to -0.04), body weight (mean difference=-2.49 kg, 95% CI: -3.11 to -1.88), waist circumference (mean difference=-3.06 cm, 95% CI: -4.21 to -1.92), and HOMA-IR (mean difference=-0.62, 95% CI: -0.84 to -0.40) compared with non-fasting. However, no statistical difference was found in the SBP, DBP, TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, fasting blood glucose, and fasting insulin comparing fasting and non-fasting group. Subgroup analyses suggested that study duration and sample size may be the source of heterogeneity for LDL-C. Sensitivity analysis indicated that our results are reliable and robust.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "IF could be used for patients with metabolic syndrome. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to verify the effectiveness and safety of IF in patients with metabolic syndrome."

      "PURPOSE": "To investigate the effect of alternating-day diet regimens on high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders in mice.",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS": "Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a continuous normal chow diet (CD, n = 10), a continuous high-fat diet (HFD, n = 10), HFD alternating every 24 h with fasting (H-ADF, n = 20), or HFD alternating every 24 h with chow diet (H-ADC, n = 20) for 12 weeks. Weights were recorded weekly and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed 6 weeks after initiating the regimens. At the end of the study, blood samples were collected and serum insulin and lipids were measured; tissues were collected for histology and RNA-seq analysis.",
      "RESULTS": "HFD significantly increased body weight and fat percentage, while HFD alternating with fasting or CD did not significantly affect body weight and fat percentage. The glucose intolerance induced by HFD was also significantly ameliorated in these two diet intervention groups. HFD-induced elevation of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and insulin were also reduced in H-ADF and H-ADC groups. Moreover, HFD-disturbed immunity, presented by Lysozyme C-1 (Lyz1) immunostaining and RNA-seq, was restored in both alternating-regimen groups, especially, with H-ADC. At the transcriptional level, some cell proliferation and lipid absorption pathways were down-regulated in both H-ADF and H-ADC groups compared to the continuous HFD group.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Alternating an HFD with a normal diet every 24 h effectively controls weight and prevents metabolic disorders and may act by affecting both fat absorption and intestinal immunity."

They also experienced greater improvements in mood, including fatigue and anger; however, they self-reported sleeping less and taking longer to fall asleep.",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "For those who can consistently adhere at least 5 d/wk, eTRE is a valuable approach for improving body weight, body fat, cardiometabolic health, and mood.

    "abstract": {
      "BACKGROUND": "Metabolic syndrome characterized by abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, elevated fasting glucose and triglyceride levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is associated with pro-inflammatory state, increased risk for atherosclerosis, and multiple cancers. Our previous results on subjects with metabolic syndrome showed that 4-week dawn-to-dusk (sunset) dry fasting resulted in significant changes in the serum proteome and improvement in several metabolic risk factors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proteomics is a powerful tool that can provide mechanistic insights into how dawn-to-dusk dry fasting affects protein expression in metabolic pathways at cellular level. In this study, we determined whether dawn-to-dusk dry fasting would induce favorable changes in PBMC proteome in subjects with metabolic syndrome, similar to the changes induced by dawn-to-dusk dry fasting in the same subjects' serum proteome.",
      "METHODS": "We conducted a prospective study on subjects with metabolic syndrome and collected blood specimens before 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting, at the end of 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting, and one week after 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting. We performed untargeted proteomics using nano ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to assess the impact of 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting on PBMC proteome.",
      "RESULTS": "There were 14 subjects with metabolic syndrome with a mean age of 59 who fasted from dawn to dusk (strict dry fasting without any liquid or food intake) for more than 14 h daily for 29 days. The quantitative proteome analysis showed that apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene protein products (GP) levels were downregulated and had the most statistical significance of the observed difference at the end of 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting (P = 0.008) and one week after 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting (P = 0.0004) compared with the levels before 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting. The comparison between GP levels before and at the end of 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting showed an alteration in the expression of genes associated with lipid and atherosclerosis pathway (P = 6.014e-4) and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway (P = 1.064e-5). The genes that were differentially expressed in the lipid and atherosclerosis pathway were APOB (P = 0.008), CD36 (P = 0.040), CALM1, CALM2, CALM3 (P = 0.015), and HSPA8 (P = 0.047). One of the differentially expressed genes in the C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway was lymphocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1), which showed an average of 19-fold increase at the end of 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting compared with the GP levels before fasting (P = 0.004). Several GPs associated with tumor-suppressor effect (TUBB4B, LSP1, ACTR3B) were upregulated, and GPs associated with tumor-promoter effect (CD36, CALM1, CALM2, CALM3, FLOT2, PPIF) were downregulated at the end of 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting or one week after 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting compared with the GP levels before 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting.",
      "CONCLUSION": "Based on our results, we conclude that in subjects with metabolic syndrome, 4-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting induced anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumorigenic PMBC proteome. Randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed to further investigate the effect of dawn-to-dusk dry fasting on subjects with chronic metabolic diseases and metabolic syndrome-induced cancers."

      "SUMMARY": "Time-restricted feeding (TRF) and Ramadan fasting (RF) have been recently associated with several health outcomes. However, it is not yet clear if they are superior to existing treatments in terms of glucose metabolism, insulin action, and weight loss. This review aims to summarize the current data on the effects of these regimes on body weight, body composition, and glycemia. An electronic search was conducted in PUBMED and SCOPUS databases up to August 2022. Twenty-four records met the inclusion criteria and underwent a risk-of-bias assessment. The main outcomes were: (a) TRF may result in moderate weight loss in individuals with overweight/obesity; when TRF is combined with caloric restriction, weight loss is >5% of the initial body weight, (b) 14 h of fasting may be as effective as 16 h in terms of weight loss, and (c) TRF may lead to improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic responses/variability throughout the day in individuals with overweight/obesity. Concerning RF, only two studies were available and thus, conclusions were not drawn. TRF may be an effective nutritional approach for weight loss, and the amelioration of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in individuals with overweight/obesity. However, more long-term, well-designed studies are needed."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Fatty acids are vital for the survival of eukaryotes, but when present in excess can have deleterious consequences. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important regulator of multiple branches of metabolism. Studies in purified enzyme preparations and cultured cells have shown that AMPK is allosterically activated by small molecules as well as fatty acyl-CoAs through a mechanism involving Ser108 within the regulatory AMPK β1 isoform. However, the in vivo physiological significance of this residue has not been evaluated. In the current study, we generated mice with a targeted germline knock-in (KI) mutation of AMPKβ1 Ser108 to Ala (S108A-KI), which renders the site phospho-deficient. S108A-KI mice had reduced AMPK activity (50 to 75%) in the liver but not in the skeletal muscle. On a chow diet, S108A-KI mice had impairments in exogenous lipid-induced fatty acid oxidation. Studies in mice fed a high-fat diet found that S108A-KI mice had a tendency for greater glucose intolerance and elevated liver triglycerides. Consistent with increased liver triglycerides, livers of S108A-KI mice had reductions in mitochondrial content and respiration that were accompanied by enlarged mitochondria, suggestive of impairments in mitophagy. Subsequent studies in primary hepatocytes found that S108A-KI mice had reductions in palmitate- stimulated Cpt1a and Ppargc1a mRNA, ULK1 phosphorylation and autophagic/mitophagic flux. These data demonstrate an important physiological role of AMPKβ1 Ser108 phosphorylation in promoting fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy under conditions of high lipid availability. As both ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting increase circulating free fatty acid levels, AMPK activity, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitophagy, these data suggest a potential unifying mechanism which may be important in mediating these effects."

      "METHODS": "Twenty participants 18-65 years with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 completed the 12-week trial. Participants randomized to TRE (",
      "RESULTS": "At preintervention, late night eating was significantly associated with higher fasting glucose (r = 0.59, ",
      "CONCLUSION": "A self-selected TRE intervention significantly shifted meal timing, reduced late-night eating while prolonging sleep duration.",

    "abstract": {
      "AIMS": "The primary goal of this meta-analysis was to examine the changes in various components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in healthy adults who observed Ramadan fasting (RF) before Ramadan (T1) and at the end of RF (T2). A secondary goal was to assess the impact of RF on MetS severity in various ethnic and sex groups using the MetS z-score.",
      "DATA SYNTHESIS": "Using PRISMA2020, seven databases were searched for relevant studies published between January 1950 and March 2022. Data extraction involved high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for T1 and T2, respectively. The MetS z-score was computed according to international diabetes federation criteria. At T1, the pooled estimates of HDL, TG, FBG, WC, SBP, DBP, and MAP were 1.20 [1.13; 1.27] mmol/L, 1.32 [1.23; 1.42] mmol/L, 4.98 [4.82; 5.15] mmol/L, 87.21 [84.21; 90.21] Cm, 114.22 [101.45; 126.99] mmHg, 76.80 [70.12; 83.47] mmHg, and 89.27 [80.56; 97.98] mmHg, respectively. At T2, the pooled estimates of HDL, TG, FBG, WC, SBP, DBP, and MAP were 1.24 [1.18; 1.31] mmol/L, 1.24 [1.14; 1.34] mmol/L, 4.77 [4.55; 4.99] mmol/L, 85.73 [82.83; 88.64] Cm, 109.48 [97.20; 121.75] mmHg, 74.43 [68.01; 80.85] mmHg, and 86.11 [77.74; 94.48] mmHg, respectively. The MetS z-score showed improvement at T2 for all ethnic groups and both sexes by -0.22 [-0.24; -0.01].",
      "CONCLUSIONS": "The current meta-analysis suggests that the RF positively impact the MetS components and the overall MetS z-score.",

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an alternating pattern of restricting eating. This study evaluated mental and physical fatigue secondary to IF (daily 18-hour fast, 7-days-a-week) in the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced male obese Sprague Dawley rats. Fifty-four rats were randomly assigned to a HFD (n = 28) or a standard diet (SD; n = 26). After six weeks, the HFD rats were divided into one of four groups: obese HFD ad libitum (OB-HFD-AL), obese HFD-IF (OB-HFD-IF), obese SD-AL (OB-SD-AL), and obese SD-IF (OB-SD-IF). Similarly, non-obese controls were grouped into HFD-AL (C-HFD-AL), non-obese HFD-IF (C-HFD-IF), non-obese SD-AL (C-SD-AL), and non-obese SD-IF (C-SD-IF). After 2 weeks of IF, mental and physical fatigue were measured using open field (OF) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Rats on IF gained weight at a slower pace (p<0.05) and had lower glucose levels (p<0.01) compared to the AL group. In non-obese rats, ketone levels were higher in the IF-HFD group than IF-SD (p<0.05) and AL-SD (p<0.01) animals. Obese rats exhibited elevated blood ketone levels in IF-SD conditions versus AL-SD rats (p<0.01). AL-HFD rats had higher ketone levels than AL-SD animals in both obese and non-obese groups (p<0.05). In conclusion, rats with higher blood ketone levels, whether they were on IF or AL, traveled a greater distance during OF suggesting a lack of physical fatigue. There was no significant difference between IF and AL during NOR indicating a lack of mental fatigue. Thus, IF results in reduced body weight and blood glucose levels but does not induce physical or mental fatigue."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Diabetes is a global, costly, and growing public health issue. Intermittent fasting (IF) and exercise therapy have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity (IS) in large studies, although the underlying processes are still unknown. The goal of this study, which included both nondiabetic and diabetic rats, was to look at the mechanisms of intermittent fasting and exercise in the management of diabetotoxicity. The effects of starvation and honey on the oral glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, adipocytokines, oxidative glucose metabolic enzymes, glycolytic enzymes, food intake, and body weight in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were also investigated. In the nondiabetic phase, rats were administered an oral regimen of distilled water (0.5 ml/rat), honey (1 g/kg body weight), and interventions with IF, and starvation for 4 weeks while in the diabetic phase, after STZ or citrate buffer injections, interventions with IF, exercise, starvation, and honey treatment began for 4 weeks. At all OGTT and ITT points, there was a substantial rise in glucose in the STZ group. Adipocytokines hormone, oxidative glucose metabolic enzymes, glycolytic enzymes, and body weight were all affected by STZ when compared to starvation and honey, however, IF and exercise significantly reduced these alterations. In diabetic rats, intermittent fasting and exercise enhanced serum adipocytokines levels. These findings imply that adipokines modulate glycolytic/nonmitochondrial enzymes and glucose metabolic/mitochondrial dehydrogenase to mediate the antidiabetic effects of intermittent fasting and exercise."

    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Glucocorticoids are the most potent anti-inflammatory agents known. Limited in vivo data are available to characterize the mechanism underlying their cognitive side effects and transient occurrence of steroid psychosis. Cholesterol is important for proper neurotransmission and brain plasticity, and disruption of its homeostasis in the brain has been closely associated with memory decline during aging and in age-related neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we assessed the direct effects of dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, on the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), major enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis, metabolism, and excretion, respectively. The effects of the dexamethasone were examined during aging, in the cortex and hippocampus of 6-, 12- and 18-month-old rats, and following long-term food restriction (FR). The most prominent change observed was the age-related decrease in ApoE mRNA regardless of the food regimen applied. In animals kept on FR, this decrease was accompanied by an increase in the mRNA expression of HMGCR and CYP46A1. The present study also demonstrates that food restriction reversed most of the dexamethasone-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in aging rats, in a region-specific manner."

    "title": "Chronotherapy with a glucokinase activator profoundly improves metabolism in obese Zucker rats.",
    "abstract": {
      "SUMMARY": "Circadian rhythms play a critical role in regulating metabolism, including daily cycles of feeding/fasting. Glucokinase (GCK) is central for whole-body glucose homeostasis and oscillates according to a circadian clock. GCK activators (GKAs) effectively reduce hyperglycemia, but their use is also associated with hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. Given the circadian rhythmicity and natural postprandial activation of GCK, we hypothesized that GKA treatment would benefit from being timed specifically during feeding periods. Acute treatment of obese Zucker rats with the GKA AZD1656 robustly increased flux into all major metabolic pathways of glucose disposal, enhancing glucose elimination. Four weeks of continuous AZD1656 treatment of obese Zucker rats improved glycemic control; however, hepatic steatosis and inflammation manifested. In contrast, timing AZD1656 to feeding periods robustly reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in addition to improving glycemia, whereas treatment timed to fasting periods caused overall detrimental metabolic effects. Mechanistically, timing AZD1656 to feeding periods diverted newly synthesized lipid toward direct VLDL secretion rather than intrahepatic storage. In line with increased hepatic insulin signaling, timing AZD1656 to feeding resulted in robust activation of AKT, mTOR, and SREBP-1C after glucose loading, pathways known to regulate VLDL secretion and hepatic de novo lipogenesis. In conclusion, intermittent AZD1656 treatment timed to feeding periods promotes glucose disposal when needed the most, restores metabolic flexibility and hepatic insulin sensitivity, and thereby avoids hepatic steatosis. Thus, chronotherapeutic approaches may benefit the development of GKAs and other drugs acting on metabolic targets."

      "SUMMARY": "The global obesity pandemic coupled with ever-growing life expectancies equates to hundreds of millions of individuals with potentially longer but not healthier lives. Aging is one of the risk factors for numerous maladies such as metabolic disorder and frailty, which are exacerbated under obesity. Thus, therapeutic approaches that address obesity to ultimately improve affected individuals' quality of life and extend their lifespan are needed. We previously reported that the every other day (EOD) fasting initiated late-life improved metabolic, musculoskeletal, and cognitive endpoints in standard rodent diet-fed mice. In the present study, using the same dietary intervention methodology, we tested if 2.5 months of EOD fasting could improve metabolic, physiological, and cognitive endpoints in mice after an 18 month obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD). The positive effects of EOD fasting were generally consistent across the endpoints; EOD fasting decreased total body mass, maintained more %lean mass, improved glucose tolerance and utilization, and improved neuromuscular function. In contrast to our previous study, grip strength, hippocampal-dependent memory, and renal hydrogen sulfide (H"

      "METHODS": "A systematic electronic literature search was conducted to find RCTs published between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2021 that directly compared IER and CER for an active weight loss period of at least 12 weeks and reported obesity indices or metabolic markers in adults with overweight or obesity. Finally, 16 RCTs from 25 articles with 1,438 participants were included.",
      "RESULTS": "The attrition rates were 26.6% and 24.1% in the IER and CER groups, respectively, with no significant differences in changes in body weight, waist circumference, or body fat composition. CER changed blood glucose levels more than IER, but there was no significant difference in glycated hemoglobin levels. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the CER group than the IER group, but diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between the groups. Changes in blood lipids did not differ significantly between the interventions. No differences between IER and CER were observed in the sensitivity analyses.",
      "CONCLUSION": "IER can be an alternative to CER because it induces comparable weight reduction and metabolic improvement. However, the effect of IER was not superior to that of CER, and its attrition rate was not lower than that of CER."
